Although it is significantly expanded from "Introduction to Music Theory", this course

will all want to delve into very different facets of music theory; although, interestingly,

if they all become very well-versed in their chosen fields, they will still end up very

capable of understanding each other and cooperating in musical endeavors. The final

section of this course does include a few challenges that are generally not considered

"beginner level" musicianship, but are very useful in just about every field and genre

of music.

The main purpose of the course, however, is to explore basic music theory so

thoroughly that the interested student will then be able to easily pick up whatever

further theory is wanted. Music history and the physics of sound are included to the

extent that they shed light on music theory. Students who find the section on

acoustics (The Physical Basis) uninteresting may skip it at first, but should then go

back to it when they begin to want to understand why musical sounds work the way

they do. Remember, the main premise of this course is that a better understanding of

where the basics come from will lead to better and faster comprehension of more

complex ideas.

It also helps to remember, however, that music theory is a bit like grammar.

Languages are invented by the people who speak them, who tend to care more about

what is easy and what makes sense than about following rules. Later, experts study

the best speakers and writers in order to discover how they use language. These

language theorists then make up rules that clarify grammar and spelling and point out

the relationships between words. Those rules are only guidelines based on patterns

discovered by the theoreticians, which is why there are usually plenty of "exceptions"

to every rule. Attempts to develop a new language by first inventing the grammar and

spelling never seem to result in a language that people find useful.

Music theory, too, always comes along after a group of composers and performers

have already developed a musical tradition. Theoreticians then study the resulting

music and discover good ways of explaining it to the audience and to other composers

music and discover good ways of explaining it to the audience and to other composers

and performers. So sometimes the answer to "Why is it that way?" is simply "that's

what is easiest for the performer", or "they borrowed that from an earlier music

tradition".

In the case of music, however, the answers to some "why"s can be found in the basic

work through this course with or without a teacher; simply use the opening sections to

review any concepts that are unclear or half-forgotten. Young students and beginning

musicians should go through it with a teacher, in either a classroom or lesson setting.

There is, even within the English-speaking world, quite a variety of music teaching

traditions, which sometimes use different terms for the same concepts. The terms

favored in this course are mostly those in common use in the U.S., but when more

than one system of terms is widely used, the alternatives are mentioned.

People were talking long before they invented writing. People were also making music

long before anyone wrote any music down. Some musicians still play "by ear" (without

written music), and some music traditions rely more on improvisation and/or "by ear"

learning. But written music is very useful, for many of the same reasons that written

words are useful. Music is easier to study and share if it is written down. Western and

Non-Western (Page 79) specializes in long, complex pieces for large groups of

musicians singing or playing parts exactly as a composer intended. Without written music, this would be too difficult. Many different types of music notation have been

invented, and some, such as tablature, are still in use. By far the most widespread way

to write music, however, is on a staff. In fact, this type of written music is so

ubiquitous that it is called common notation.

The staff (plural staves) is written as five horizontal parallel lines. Most of the notes of

the music are placed on one of these lines or in a space in between lines. Extra ledger

lines may be added to show a note that is too high or too low to be on the staff.

Vertical bar lines divide the staff into short sections called measures or bars. A

double bar line, either heavy or light, is used to mark the ends of larger sections of

music, including the very end of a piece, which is marked

Staves are read from left to right. Beginning at the top of the page, they are read one

staff at a time unless they are connected. If staves should be played at the same time

(by the same person or by different people), they will be connected at least by a long

vertical line at the left hand side. They may also be connected by their bar lines. Staves

played by similar instruments or voices, or staves that should be played by the same

person (for example, the right hand and left hand of a piano part) may be grouped

together by braces or brackets at the beginning of each line.

The first symbol that appears at the beginning of every music staff is a clef symbol. It

is very important because it tells you which note (A, B, C, D, E, F, or G) is found on each

line or space. For example, a treble clef symbol tells you that the second line from the

bottom (the line that the symbol curls around) is "G". On any staff, the notes are

always arranged so that the next letter is always on the next higher line or space. The

last note letter, G, is always followed by another A.

One of the first steps in learning to read music in a particular clef is memorizing where

the notes are. Many students prefer to memorize the notes and spaces separately.

Figure 1.6 are some of the most popular mnemonics used.

The bass and treble clefs were also once moveable, but it is now very rare to see them

anywhere but in their standard positions. If you do see a treble or bass clef symbol in

an unusual place, remember: treble clef is a G clef; its spiral curls around a G. Bass

clef is an F clef; its two dots center around an F.

Much more common is the use of a treble clef that is meant to be read one octave

below the written pitch. Since many people are uncomfortable reading bass clef,

someone writing music that is meant to sound in the region of the bass clef may

decide to write it in the treble clef so that it is easy to read. A very small "8" at the

bottom of the treble clef symbol means that the notes should sound one octave lower

than they are written.

one octave lower than written.

Figure 1.10 Same notes written in treble and bass clef These scores show the same notes written in

treble and in bass clef. The staff with fewer ledger lines is easier to read and write.

The G indicated by the treble clef is the G above middle C, while the F indicated by the

bass clef is the F below middle C. (C clef indicates middle C.) So treble clef and bass

clef together cover many of the notes that are in the range of human voices and of

most instruments. Voices and instruments with higher ranges usually learn to read

treble clef, while voices and instruments with lower ranges usually learn to read bass

clef. Instruments with ranges that do not fall comfortably into either bass or treble clef

may use a C clef or may be transposing instruments.

The pitch of a note is how high or low it sounds. Pitch depends on the frequency of

the fundamental sound wave of the note. The higher the frequency of a sound wave,

and the shorter its wavelength, the higher its pitch sounds. But musicians usually

don't want to talk about wavelengths and frequencies. Instead, they just give the

different pitches different letter names: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. These seven letters

Figure 1.13 Sharp, flat, and natural signs can appear either in the key signature,or right in front of

the note that they change.

A sharp sign means "the note that is one half step higher than the natural note". A

flat sign means "the note that is one half step lower than the natural note". Some of

the natural notes are only one half step apart, but most of them are a whole step

apart. When they are a whole step apart, the note in between them can only be

named using a flat or a sharp.

Notice that, using flats and sharps, any pitch can be given more than one note name.

For example, the G sharp and the A flat are played on the same key on the keyboard;

they sound the same. You can also name and write the F natural as "E sharp"; F

natural is the note that is a half-step higher than E natural, which is the definition of E

sharp. Notes that have different names but sound the same are called enharmonic

notes.

Figure 1.15 G sharp and A flat sound the same. E sharp and F natural sound the same.

Sharp and flat signs can be used in two ways: they can be part of a key signature, or

they can mark accidentals. For example, if most of the C's in a piece of music are going

to be sharp, then a sharp sign is put in the "C" space at the beginning of the staff, in

the key signature. If only a few of the C's are going to be sharp, then those C's are

marked individually with a sharp sign right in front of them. Pitches that are not in the

key signature are called accidentals.

Figure 1.16 When a sharp sign appears in the C space in the key signature, all C's are sharp unless

marked as accidentals.

A note can also be double sharp or double flat. A double sharp is two half steps (one

whole step) higher than the natural note; a double flat is two half steps (a whole step)

lower. Triple, quadruple, etc. sharps and flats are rare, but follow the same pattern:

every sharp or flat raises or lowers the pitch one more half step. Using double or triple

sharps or flats may seem to be making things more diffcult than they need to be. Why

not call the note "A natural" instead of "G double sharp"? The answer is that, although

A natural and G double sharp are the same pitch, they don't have the same function

within a particular chord or a particular key. For musicians who understand some

music theory (and that includes most performers, not just composers and music

teachers), calling a note "G double sharp" gives important and useful information

then the key signature is "all notes are natural". In common notation, clef and key

signature are the only symbols that normally appear on every staff. They appear so

often because they are such important symbols; they tell you what note is on each line

The key signature is a list of all the sharps and flats in the key that the music is in.

When a sharp (or flat) appears on a line or space in the key signature, all the notes on

that line or space are sharp (or flat), and all other notes with the same letter names in other octaves are also sharp (or flat).

Figure 1.19 This key signature has a flat on the "B" line, so all of these B's are flat.

The sharps or flats always appear in the same order in all key signatures. This is the

same order in which they are added as keys get sharper or flatter. For example, if a

key (G major or E minor) has only one sharp, it will be F sharp, so F sharp is always the

first sharp listed in a sharp key signature. The keys that have two sharps (D major and

B minor) have F sharp and C sharp, so C sharp is always the second sharp in a key

signature, and so on. The order of sharps is: F sharp, C sharp, G sharp, D sharp, A

sharp, E sharp, B sharp. The order of flats is the reverse of the order of sharps: B flat, E

flat, A flat, D flat, G flat, C flat, F flat. So the keys with only one flat (F major and D

minor) have a B flat; the keys with two flats (B flat major and G minor) have B flat and

E flat; and so on. The order of flats and sharps, like the order of the keys themselves,

If you do not know the name of the key of a piece of music, the key signature can help

you find out. Assume for a moment that you are in a major key. If the key contains

sharps, the name of the key is one half step higher than the last sharp in the key

signature. If the key contains flats, the name of the key signature is the name of the

second-to-last flat in the key signature.

The only major keys that these rules do not work for are C major (no flats or sharps)

and F major (one flat). It is easiest just to memorize the key signatures for these two

very common keys. If you want a rule that also works for the key of F major, remember that the second-to-last flat is always a Perfect Intervals (Page 127) higher

than (or a perfect fifth lower than) the final flat. So you can also say that the name of

the key signature is a perfect fourth lower than the name of the final flat.

Why do we bother with these symbols? There are twelve pitches available within any

octave. We could give each of those twelve pitches its own name (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I,

J, K, and L) and its own line or space on a staff. But that would actually be fairly

inefficient, because most music is in a particular key. And music that is in a major or minor key will tend to use only seven of those twelve notes. So music is easier to read

if it has only lines, spaces, and notes for the seven pitches it is (mostly) going to use,

plus a way to write the occasional notes that are not in the key.

This is basically what common notation does. There are only seven note names (A, B,

C, D, E, F, G), and each line or space on a staff will correspond with one of those note

names. To get all twelve pitches using only the seven note names, we allow any of

these notes to be sharp, flat, or natural. Look at the notes on a Figure 1.25.

Figure 1.25 Seven of the twelve possible notes in each octave are "natural" notes.

Because most of the natural notes are two half steps apart, there are plenty of pitches

that you can only get by naming them with either a flat or a sharp (on the keyboard,

the "black key" notes). For example, the note in between D natural and E natural can

be named either D sharp or E flat. These two names look very different on the staff,

but they are going to sound exactly the same, since you play both of them by pressing

the same black key on the piano.

Figure 1.26 D sharp and E flat look very different when written in common notation, but they sound

This is an example of enharmonic spelling. Two notes are enharmonic if they sound

Name the other enharmonic notes that are listed above the black keys on the

keyboard in this Figure 1.25. Write them on a treble clef staff. If you need staff paper,

you can print out this PDF file.

But these are not the only possible enharmonic notes. Any note can be flat or sharp,

so you can have, for example, an E sharp. Looking at the Figure 1.25 and remembering

that the definition of sharp is "one half step higher than natural", you can see that an

E sharp must sound the same as an F natural. Why would you choose to call the note E

sharp instead of F natural? Even though they sound the same, E sharp and F natural,

as they are actually used in music, are different notes. (They may, in some

circumstances, also sound different; see below.) Not only will they look different when

written on a staff, but they will have different functions within a key and different

relationships with the other notes of a piece of music. So a composer may very well

relationships with the other notes of a piece of music. So a composer may very well

prefer to write an E sharp, because that makes the note's place in the harmonies of a

piece more clear to the performer. (Please see Triads, Beyond Triads, and Harmonic

Analysis for more on how individual notes fit into chords and harmonic progressions.)

In fact, this need (to make each note's place in the harmony very clear) is so important

that double sharps and double flats have been invented to help do it. A double sharp

is two half steps (one whole step) higher than the natural note. A double flat is two

half steps lower than the natural note. Double sharps and flats are fairly rare, and

triple and quadruple flats even rarer, but all are allowed.

Keys and scales can also be enharmonic. Major keys, for example, always follow the

same pattern of half steps and whole steps. (See Major Keys and Scales (Page 115).

Minor keys also all follow the same pattern, different from the major scale pattern;

see Music in a Minor Key (Page 118).) So whether you start a major scale on an E flat,

or start it on a D sharp, you will be following the same pattern, playing the same piano

keys as you go up the scale. But the notes of the two scales will have different names, the scales will look very different when written, and musicians may think of them as

being different. For example, most instrumentalists would find it easier to play in E flat

than in D sharp. In some cases, an E flat major scale may even sound slightly different

from a D sharp major scale.

Figure 1.28 The E flat major and D sharp major scales sound the same on the piano, although they

look very different. If this surprises you, look again at the piano keyboard (Figure 1.28) and find the

notes that you would play for each scale.

Since the scales are the same, D sharp major and E flat major are also enharmonic

keys. Again, their key signatures will look very different, but music in D sharp will not

be any higher or lower than music in E flat.

sound the same on a keyboard.

Chords (Chords) and intervals also can have enharmonic spellings. Again, it is

important to name a chord or interval as it has been spelled, in order to understand

how it fits into the rest of the music. A C sharp major chord means something

different in the key of D than a D flat major chord does. And an interval of a

diminished fourth means something different than an interval of a major third, even

though they would be played using the same keys on a piano. (For practice naming

intervals, see Interval. For practice naming chords, see Naming Triads (Page 159) and

Beyond Triads: Naming Other Chords (Page 165). For an introduction to how chords

function in a harmony, see Beginning Harmonic Analysis (Page 171).)

tune quickly (for example violins, clarinets, and trombones) often move away from

equal temperament. They sometimes drift, consciously or unconsciously, towards just

intonation, which is more closely based on the Harmonic Series I: Timbre and Octaves

(Page 100). When this happens, enharmonically spelled notes, scales, intervals, and

chords, may not only be theoretically different. They may also actually be slightly

different pitches. The differences between, say, a D sharp and an E flat, when this

happens, are very small, but may be large enough to be noticeable. Many Classifying

Music (Page 79) also do not use equal temperament. Sharps and flats used to notate

music in these traditions should not be assumed to mean a change in pitch equal to

an equal-temperament half-step. For definitions and discussions of equal

temperament, just intonation, and other tuning systems, please see Tuning Systems

(Page 197).

In standard notation, a single musical sound is written as a note. The two most

important things a written piece of music needs to tell you about a note are its pitch -

how high or low it is - and its duration - how long it lasts.

To find out the pitch of a written note, you look at the clef and the key signature, then

see what line or space the note is on. The higher a note sits on the staff, the higher it

sounds. To find out the duration of the written note, you look at the tempo and the

time signature and then see what the note looks like.

The head of the note may be filled in (black), or not. The note may also have (or not) a

stem, one or more flags, beams connecting it to other notes, or one or more dots

following the head of the note. All of these things affect how much time the note is

given in the music.

Note: A dot that is someplace other than next to the head of the note does not

affect the rhythm. Other dots are articulation marks. They may affect the

actual length of the note (the amount of time it sounds), but do not affect the

amount of time it must be given. (The extra time when the note could be

sounding, but isn't, becomes an unwritten rest.) If this is confusing, please see

The simplest-looking note, with no stems or flags, is a whole note. All other note

lengths are defined by how long they last compared to a whole note. A note that lasts

half as long as a whole note is a half note. A note that lasts a quarter as long as a

whole note is a quarter note. The pattern continues with eighth notes, sixteenth

notes, thirty-second notes, sixty-fourth notes, and so on, each type of note being

half the length of the previous type. (There is no such thing as third notes, sixth notes,

tenth notes, etc.; see Dots, Ties, and Borrowed Divisions (Page 36) to find out how

notes of unusual lengths are written.)

You may have noticed that some of the eighth notes in above Figure 1.36 don't have

flags; instead they have a beam connecting them to another eighth note. If flagged

notes are next to each other, their flags can be replaced by beams that connect the

notes into easy-to-read groups. The beams may connect notes that are all in the same

beat, or, in some vocal music, they may connect notes that are sung on the same text

syllable. Each note will have the same number of beams as it would have flags.

Figure 1.37 Notes with Beams The notes connected with beams are easier to read quickly than the flagged

notes. Notice that each note has the same number of beams as it would have flags, even if it is connected to

a different type of note. The notes are often (but not always) connected so that each beamed group gets

one beat. This makes the notes easier to read quickly.

You may have also noticed that the note lengths sound like fractions in arithmetic. In

fact they work very much like fractions: two half notes will be equal to (last as long as)

one whole note; four eighth notes will be the same length as one half note; and so on.

So how long does each of these notes actually last? That depends on a couple of

things. A written note lasts for a certain amount of time measured in beats. To find

out exactly how many beats it takes, you must know the time signature. And to find

out how long a beat is, you need to know the tempo.

Whether a stem points up or down does not affect the note length at all. There are

two basic ideas that lead to the rules for stem direction. One is that the music should

be as easy as possible to read and understand. The other is that the notes should tend

to be "in the staff" as much as reasonably possible.

on or above the middle line should be stem down.

2. Notes sharing a stem (block chords) - Generally, the stem direction will be the

direction for the note that is furthest away from the middle line of the staff

3. Notes sharing a beam - Again, generally you will want to use the stem direction of

the note farthest from the center of the staff, to keep the beam near the staff.

4. Different rhythms being played at the same time by the same player - Clarity requires

that you write one rhythm with stems up and the other stems down.

5. Two parts for different performers written on the same staff - If the parts have the

same rhythm, they may be written as block chords. If they do not, the stems for

one part (the "high" part or "first" part) will point up and the stems for the other

part will point down.This rule is especially important when the two parts cross;

Rests don't necessarily mean that there is silence in the music at that point; only that

that part is silent. Often, on a The Staff (Page 3) with multiple parts, a rest must be

used as a placeholder for one of the parts, even if a single person is playing both

parts. When the rhythms are complex, this is necessary to make the rhythm in each

The downbeat is the strongest part of the beat, but some downbeats are stronger

than others. Usually a pattern can be heard in the beats: strong-weak-weak-strong-

weak-weak, or strong-weak-strong- weak. So beats are organized even further by

grouping them into bars, or measures. (The two words mean the same thing.) For

example, for music with a beat pattern of strong-weak-weakstrong- weak-weak, or

Figure 1.47 Time Signatures In "four four" time, there are four beats in a measure and a quarter note gets

a beat. Any combination of notes that equals four quarters can be used to fill up a measure.

You may have noticed that the time signature looks a little like a fraction in arithmetic.

Filling up measures feels a little like finding equivalent fractions, too. In "four four

time", for example, there are four beats in a measure and a quarter note gets one

beat. So four quarter notes would fill up one measure. But so would any other

combination of notes that equals four quarters: one whole, two halves, one half plus

note it follows. Listen21 to the rhythms in Figure 1.51.

Write each of the time signatures below (with a clef symbol) at the beginning of a staff. Write at least four measures of music in each time signature. Fill each measure with a

different combination of note lengths. Use at least one dotted note on each staff. If

you need some staff paper, you can download this PDF file.

1. Two four time

2. Three eight time

3. Six four time

A few time signatures don't have to be written as numbers. Four four time is used so

much that it is often called common time, written as a bold "C". When both fours are

"cut" in half to twos, you have cut time, written as a "C" cut by a vertical slash.

You may have already noticed that a measure in four four time looks the same as a

measure in two two. After all, in arithmetic, four quarters adds up to the same thing as

two halves. For that matter, why not call the time signature "one one" or "eight eight"?

many downbeats there are in a measure.

Or why not write two two as two four, giving quarter notes the beat instead of half

notes? The music would look very different, but it would sound the same, as long as

you made the beats the same speed. The music in each of the staves in below Figure

Figure 1.51 The music in each of these staves should sound exactly alike.

So why is one time signature chosen rather than another? The composer will normally

choose a time signature that makes the music easy to read and also easy to count and

conduct. Does the music feel like it has four beats in every measure, or does it go by

so quickly that you only have time to tap your foot twice in a measure?

A common exception to this is six eight time, and the other time signatures (for

example nine eight and twelve eight) commonly used to write compound meters. A

piece in six eight might have six beats in every measure, with an eighth note getting a

beat. But it is more likely that the conductor will give only two beats per measure, with

a dotted quarter (or three eighth notes) getting one beat. Since beats normally get

divided into halves and quarters, this is the easiest way for composers to write beats

music, such as some native American flute music, may not have a strong, repetitive

pattern of beats. Other types of music, such as traditional Western African drumming,

may have very complex meters that can be difficult for the beginner to identify.

But most Classifying Music (Page 79) music has simple, repetitive patterns of beats.

This makesmeter a very useful way to organize the music. Common notation, for

example, divides the written music into small groups of beats called measures, or

Beats and Measures (Page 28). The lines dividing each measure from the next help the

musician reading the music to keep track of the Rhythm (Page 60). A piece (or section

of the piece) is assigned a time signature that tells the performer how many beats to

expect in each measure, and what type of note should get one beat. (For more on

reading time signatures, please see Time Signature.)

Conducting also depends on the meter of the piece; conductors use different

conducting patterns for the different meters. These patterns emphasize the

differences between the stronger and weaker beats to help the performers keep track

of where they are in the music.

But the conducting patterns depend only on the pattern of strong and weak beats. In

other words, they only depend on "how many beats there are in a measure", not

"what type of note gets a beat". So even though the time signature is often called the

"meter" of a piece, one can talk about meter without worrying about the time

signature or even being able to read music. (Teachers, note that this means that

children can be introduced to the concept of meter long before they are reading

music. See Meter Activities for some suggestions.)

Meters can be classified by counting the number of beats from one strong beat to the next. For example, if the meter of the music feels like "strong-weak-strong-weak", it is

in duple meter. "strongweak-weak-strong-weak-weak" is triple meter, and "strong-

weak-weak-weak" is quadruple. (Most people don't bother classifying the more

unusual meters, such as those with five beats in a measure.)

Meters can also be classified as either simple or compound. In a simple meter, each

beat is basically divided into halves. In compound meters, each beat is divided into

thirds.

A borrowed division occurs whenever the basic meter of a piece is interrupted by

some beats that sound like they are "borrowed" from a different meter. One of the

most common examples of this is the use of triplets to add some compound meter to

a piece that is mostly in a simple meter. (See Dots, Ties, and Borrowed Divisions to see

To learn to recognize meter, remember that (in most Western music) the beats and

the subdivisions of beats are all equal and even. So you are basically listening for a

running, even pulse underlying the rhythms of the music. For example, if it makes

sense to count along with the music "ONE-and-Two-and-ONE-and-Two-and" (with all

the syllables very evenly spaced) then you probably have a simple duple meter. But if

it's more comfortable to count "ONE-and-a-Two-anda-ONE-and-a-Two-and-a", it's

probably compound duple meter. (Make sure numbers always come on a pulse, and

"one" always on the strongest pulse.)

There is one common exception to this rule. (There are also some less common

exceptions not discussed here.) Often, a piece of music does not begin on the

strongest downbeat. Instead, the strong beat that people like to count as "one" (the

beginning of a measure), happens on the second or third note, or even later. In this

case, the first measure may be a full measure that begins with some rests. But often

the first measure is simply not a full measure. This shortened first measure is called a

pickup measure.

If there is a pickup measure, the final measure of the piece should be shortened by

the length of the pickup measure (although this rule is sometimes ignored in less

formal written music). For example, if the meter of the piece has four beats, and the

pickup measure has one beat, then the final measure should have only three beats.

(Of course, any combination of notes and rests can be used, as long as the total in the

first and final measures equals one full measure.

A piece that is using pickup measures or pickup notes may also sometimes place a

double bar (with or without repeat signs) inside a measure, in order to make it clear

which phrase and which section of the music the pickup notes belong to. If this

happens (which is a bit rare, because it can be confusing to read), there is still a single

bar line where it should be, at the end of the measure.

Figure 1.57 At the ends of sections of the music, a measure may be interrupted by a double bar that

places the pickup notes in the correct section and assures that repeats have the correct number of

beats. When this happens, the bar line will still appear at the end of the completed measure. This

notation can be confusing, though, and in some music the pickups and repeats are written in a way

that avoids these broken-up measures.

One way to get a different length is by dotting the note or rest. A dotted note is one-

and-a-half times the length of the same note without the dot. In other words, the note

keeps its original length and adds another half of that original length because of the

dot. So a dotted half note, for example, would last as long as a half note plus a quarter

Dots and ties give you much freedom to write notes of varying lengths, but so far you

must build your notes from halves of other notes. If you want to divide a note length

into anything other than halves or halves of halves - if you want to divide a beat into

thirds or fifths, for example - you must write the number of the division over the

notes. These unusual subdivisions are called borrowed divisions because they sound

as if they have been borrowed from a completely different meter. They can be difficult

to perform correctly and are avoided in music for beginners. The only one that is

commonly used is triplets, which divide a note length into equal thirds.

The notes are labeled with the appropriate number. If there might be any question as to which notes are

involved in the borrowed division, a bracket is placed above them. Triplets are by far the most common

Figure 1.63 Borrowed Duplets In a compound meter (Section 1.2.4), which normally divides a beat into

three, the borrowed division may divide the beat into two, as in a simple meter. You may also see duplets in

swing music.

Notes in jazzy-sounding music that has a "swing" beat are often assumed to be triplet

rhythms, even when they look like regular divisions; for example, two written eighth

notes (or a dotted quartersixteenth) might sound like a triplet quarter-eighth rhythm.

In jazz and other popular music styles, a tempo (Section 1.2.8) notation that says

swing usually means that all rhythms should be played as triplets. Straight means to

play the rhythms as written.

Note: Some jazz musicians prefer to think of a swing rhythm as more of a heavy accent on the second eighth, rather than as a triplet rhythm, particularly

when the tempo is fast. This distinction is not important for students of music

theory, but jazz students will want to work hard on using both rhythm and

theory, but jazz students will want to work hard on using both rhythm and

articulation to produce a convincing "swing".

Figure 1.64 Swing Rhythms Jazz or blues with a "swing" rhythm often assumes that all divisions are

triplets. The swung triplets may be written as triplets, or they may simply be written as "straight" eighth

notes or dotted eighth-sixteenths. If rhythms are not written as triplets, the tempo marking usually includes

an indication to "swing", or it may simply be implied by the style and genre of the music.

A syncopation or syncopated rhythm is any rhythm that puts an emphasis on a

beat, or a subdivision of a beat, that is not usually emphasized. One of the most

obvious features of Western music, to be heard in most everything from Bach to

blues, is a strong, steady beat that can easily be grouped evenly into measures.

(In other words, each measure has the same number of beats, and you can hear the

measures in the music because the first beat of the measure is the strongest. See

clap your hands to the music. But music that follows the same rhythmic pattern all the

time can get pretty boring.

Syncopation is one way to liven things up. The music can suddenly emphasize the

weaker beats of the measure, or it can even emphasize notes that are not on the beat

at all. For example, listen to the melody in the following figure.

Figure 1.65 Syncopation A syncopation may involve putting an "important" note on a weak beat, or off the

beat altogether.

The first measure clearly establishes a simple quadruple meter ("ONE and two and

THREE and four and"), in which important things, like changes in the melody, happen

on beat one or three. But then, in the second measure, syncopation happens; the

longest and highest note is on beat two, normally a weak beat. In the syncopation in

the third measure, the longest note doesn't even begin on a beat; it begins half-way

through the third beat. (Some musicians would say "on the up-beat" or "on the 'and'

of three".) Now listen to another example from a Boccherini minuet. Again, some of

the long notes begin half-way between the beats, or "on the up-beat".

Notice, however, that in other places in the music, the melody establishes the meter

very strongly, so that the syncopations are easily heard to be syncopations.

Figure 1.66 Syncopation is one of the most important elements in ragtime music, as illustrated in

this example from Scott Joplin's Peacherine Rag. Notice that the syncopated notes in the melody

come on the second and fourth quarters of the beat, essentially alternating with the strong eighth-

note pattern laid down in the accompaniment.

Another way to strongly establish the meter is to have the syncopated rhythm playing

in one part of the music while another part plays a more regular rhythm, as in this

passage45 from Scott Joplin (see Figure 1.66). Syncopations can happen anywhere: in

the melody, the bass line (Accompaniment), the rhythm section, the chordal

by a syncopation. It can suddenly be made important by a long or high note in the

melody, a change in direction of the melody, a chord change, or a written accent.

Depending on the tempo of the music and the type of syncopation, a syncopated

rhythm can make the music sound jaunty, jazzy, unsteady, surprising, uncertain,

exciting, or just more interesting.

tradition. Syncopation is such an important aspect of much American music, in fact,

that the type of syncopation used in a piece is one of the most important clues to the

style and genre of the music. Ragtime46, for example, would hardly be ragtime

without the jaunty syncopations in the melody set against the steady unsyncopated

bass. The "swing" rhythm in big-band jazz and the "back-beat" of many types of rock

The tempo of a piece of music is its speed. There are two ways to specify a tempo.

Metronome markings are given in beats per minute. They can be estimated using a

clock with a second hand, but the easiest way to find them is with a metronome,

which is a tool that can give a beat-per-minute tempo as a clicking sound or a pulse of

light. This Figure 1.68 shows some examples of metronome markings.

Metronomes often come with other tempo indications written on them, but this is

misleading. For example, a metronome may have allegro marked at 120 beats per

minute and andante marked at 80 beats per minute. Allegro should certainly be quite

a bit faster than andante, but it may not be exactly 120 beats per minute.

A tempo marking that is a word or phrase gives you the composer's idea of how fast

the music should feel. How fast a piece of music feels depends on several different

things, including the texture and complexity of the music, how often the beat gets

divided into faster notes, and how fast the beats themselves are (the metronome

marking). Also, the same tempo marking can mean quite different things to different composers; if a metronome marking is not available, the performer should use a

knowledge of the music's style and genre, and musical common sense, to decide on

the proper tempo. When possible, listening to a professional play the piece can help

with tempo decisions, but it is also reasonable for different performers to prefer

slightly different tempos for the same piece.

Check to see how comfortable you are with Italian tempo markings by translating the

following.

1. un poco allegro

2. molto meno mosso

3. piu vivo

4. molto adagio

5. poco piu mosso

Of course, tempo instructions don't have to be given in Italian. Much folk, popular, and

modern music, gives instructions in English or in the composer's language. Tempo

indications such as "Not too fast", "With energy", "Calmly", or "March tempo" give a

good idea of how fast the music should feel.

If the tempo of a piece of music suddenly changes into a completely different tempo,

there will be a new tempo given, usually marked in the same way (metronome tempo,

Italian term, etc.) as the original tempo. Gradual changes in the basic tempo are also

common in music, though, and these have their own set of terms. These terms often

appear below the staff, although writing them above the staff is also allowed. These

terms can also appear with modifiers (More useful Italian) like molto or un poco. You

may notice that there are quite a few terms for slowing down. Again, the use of these

terms will vary from one composer to the next; unless beginning and ending tempo

markings are included, the performer must simply use good musical judgement to

decide how much to slow down in a particular ritardando or rallentando.

Repetition, either exact or with small or large variations, is one of the basic organizing

principles of music. Repeated notes, Motif (Page 66), phrases, Melody (Page 62),

rhythms, chord progressions (Chords), and even entire repeated sections in the

overall form, are all very crucial in helping the listener make sense of the music. So

good music is surprisingly repetitive!

So, in order to save time, ink, and page turns, common notation has many ways to

show that a part of the music should be repeated exactly.

If the repeated part is very small - only one or two measures, for example - the repeat

sign will probably look something like those in Figure 1.69. If you have very many such

repeated measures in a row, you may want to number them (in pencil) to help you

keep track of where you are in the music.in a row, you may want to number them (in

It is very common for longer repeated sections of music to be repeated exactly until

the last few measures. When this happens, the repeat dots will be put in an ending.

The bracket over the music shows you which measures to play each time you arrive at

that point in the music. For example, the second time you reach a set of endings, you

will skip the music in all the other endings; play only the measures in the second

ending, and then do whatever the second ending directs you to do (repeat, go on, skip

to somewhere else, etc.).

Figure 1.71 Repeat Endings Some "endings" of a section of music may include a repeat, while others do

not. Play only one ending each time (skipping over other, previously played endings when necessary), and

then follow the "instructions" at the end of the ending (to repeat, go on, go someplace else, etc.).

When you are repeating large sections in more informally written music, you may

simply find instructions in the music such as "to refrain", "to bridge", "to verses", etc.

Or you may find extra instructions to play certain parts "only on the repeat". Usually

these instructions are reasonably clear, although you may need to study the music for

a minute to get the "road map" clear in your mind. Pencilled-in markings can be a big

help if it's difficult to spot the place you need to skip to. In order to help clarify things,

repeat dots and other repeat instructions are almost always marked by a double bar

Again, instructions can easily get quite complicated, and these large-section markings

may require you to study your part for a minute to see how it is laid out, and even to

mark (in pencil) circles and arrows that help you find the way quickly while you are

playing. This Figure 1.73 contains a few very simplistic examples of how these "road

instructions may be arranged. These types of signs usually mark longer repeated sections.

In many styles of music, a short repeated section (usually marked with repeat dots) is

often not repeated after a da capo or dal segno.

Sounds, including music, can be barely audible, or loud enough to hurt your ears, or

anywhere in between. When they want to talk about the loudness of a sound,

scientists and engineers talk about amplitude (Section 3.1.3). Musicians talk about

dynamics. The amplitude of a sound is a particular number, usually measured in

decibels, but dynamics are relative; an orchestra playing fortissimo is going to be

much louder than a single violin playing fortissimo. The exact interpretation of each

dynamic marking in a piece of music depends on:

comparison with other dynamics in that piece

Traditionally, dynamic markings are based on Italian words, although there is nothing

wrong with simply writing things like "quietly" or "louder" in the music. Forte means

loud and piano means soft. The instrument commonly called the "piano" by the way,

was originally called a "pianoforte" because it could play dynamics, unlike earlier

popular keyboard instruments like the harpsichord.

When a composer writes a forte into a part, followed by a piano, the intent is for the music to be quite loud, and then suddenly quite soft. If the composer wants the

change from one dynamic level to another to be gradual, different markings are

added. A crescendo (pronounced "cresh-EN-doe") means "gradually get louder"; a

decrescendo or diminuendo means "gradually get softer".

A composer may want a particular note to be louder than all the rest, or may want the

very beginning of a note to be loudest. Accents are markings that are used to indicate

these especially strong- sounding notes. There are a few different types of written

accents, but, like dynamics, the proper way to perform a given accent also depends on

the instrument playing it, as well as the style and period of the music. Some accents

may even be played by making the note longer or shorter than the other notes, in

addition to, or even instead of being, louder. (See articulation for more about accents.)

and the style and period of the music, but the sforzando and fortepiano-type accents are usually louder and

longer, and more likely to be used in a long note that starts loudly and then suddenly gets much softer.

Caret-type accents are more likely to be used to mark shorter notes that should be stronger than unmarked

notes.

The word articulation generally refers to how the pieces of something are joined

together; for example, how bones are connected to make a skeleton or syllables are

connected to make a word. Articulation depends on what is happening at the

beginning and end of each segment, as well as in between the segments.

might be performed by any musician or group of musicians: a singer, for example, or a

bassoonist, a violin section, or a trumpet and saxophone together. In any case, it is a

string of notes that follow one after the other and that belong together in the music.

The articulation is what happens in between the notes. The attack - the beginning of a note - and the amount of space in between the notes are particularly important.

Descriptions of how each articulation is done cannot be given here, because they

depend too much on the particular instrument that is making the music. In other

words, the technique that a violin player uses to slur notes will be completely different

from the technique used by a trumpet player, and a pianist and a vocalist will do

different things to make a melody sound legato. In fact, the violinist will have some

articulations available (such as pizzicato, or "plucked") that a trumpet player will never

So if you are wondering how to play slurs on your guitar or staccato on your clarinet,

ask your music teacher or director. What you will find here is a short list of the most

common articulations: their names, what they look like when notated, and a vague description of how they sound. The descriptions have to be vague, because

articulation, besides depending on the instrument, also depends on the style of the

music. Exactly how much space there should be between staccato eighth notes, for

example, depends on tempo as well as on whether you're playing Rossini or Sousa. To

give you some idea of the difference that articulation makes, though, here are audio

examples of a violin playing a legato and a staccato passage. (For more audio

examples of violin articulations, please see Common Violin Terminology.)

Staccato notes are short, with plenty of space between them. Please note that this

doesn't mean that the tempo or rhythm goes any faster. The tempo and rhythm are

not affected by articulations; the staccato notes sound shorter than written only

because of the extra space between them.

Legato is the opposite of staccato. The notes are very connected; there is no space

Accents - An accent requires that a note stand out more than the unaccented notes

around it. Accents are usually performed by making the accented note, or the

beginning of the accented note, louder than the rest of the music. Although this is

mostly a quick change in dynamics, it usually affects the articulation of the note, too.

The extra loudness of the note often requires a stronger, more definite attack at the

beginning of the accented note, and it is emphasized by putting some space before

and after the accented notes. The effect of a lot of accented notes in a row may sound

marcato.

and fortepiano accents involve a loud beginning to a longer note. They are usually heavier and longer than

caret-type accents, which often rely more on a powerful attack (pg 58) to make a short note louder than the

notes around it.

A slur is marked by a curved line joining any number of notes. When notes are

slurred, only the first note under each slur marking has a definite articulation at the

beginning. The rest of the notes are so seamlessly connected that there is no break

between the notes. A good example of slurring occurs when a vocalist sings more than

one note on the same syllable of text.

A tie looks like a slur, but it is between two notes that are the same pitch. A tie is not

really an articulation marking. It is included here because it looks like one, which can

cause confusion for beginners. When notes are tied together, they are played as if

they are one single note that is the length of all the notes that are tied together.

(Please see Dots, Ties, and Borrowed Divisions.)

Figure 1.81 Slurs vs. Ties A slur marking indicates no articulation - no break in the sound - between notes

of different pitches. A tie is used between two notes of the same pitch. Since there is no articulation

between them, they sound like a single note. The tied quarters here would sound exactly like a half note

crossing the bar line. Like a note that crosses bar lines, the two-and-a-half-beat "note" in the fourth bar

would be difficult to write without using a tie.

A portamento is a smooth glide between the two notes, including all the pitches in

between. For some instruments, like violin56 and trombone57, this includes even the

pitches in between the written notes. For other instruments, such as guitar58, it

means sliding through all of the possible notes between the two written pitches.

Although unusual in traditional common notation, a type of portamento that includes

only one written pitch can be found in some styles of music, notably jazz, blues, and

rock. As the notation (Figure 1.83) suggests, the proper performance of scoops and

fall-offs requires that the portamento begins (in scoops) or ends (in fall-offs) with the

slide itself, rather than with a specific note.

Figure 1.83 Scoops and Fall-offs The notation for scoops and fall-offs has not been standardized, but

either one will look something like a portamento or slur with a note on one end only.

Some articulations may be some combination of staccato, legato, and accent.

Marcato, for example means "marked" in the sense of "stressed" or "noticeable".

Notes marked marcato have enough of an accent and/or enough space between them

to make each note seem stressed or set apart. They are usually longer than staccato

but shorter than legato. Other notes may be marked with a combination of

articulation symbols, for example legato with accents. As always, the best way to

perform such notes depends on the instrument and the style of the music.

Plenty of music has no articulation marks at all, or marks on only a few notes. Often,

such music calls for notes that are a little more separate or defined than legato, but

still nowhere as short as staccato. Mostly, though, it is up to the performer to know

what is considered proper for a particular piece. For example, most ballads are sung

legato, and most marches are played fairly staccato or marcato, whether they are

marked that way or not. Furthermore, singing or playing a phrase with musicianship

often requires knowing which notes of the phrase should be legato, which should be

more separate, where to add a little portamento, and so on. This does not mean the

best players consciously decide how to play each note. Good articulation comes

naturally to the musician who has mastered the instrument and the style of the music.

A has a very strong, quick 1-2-3 beat.

B is in a slow (easy) 2. You may feel it in a fast 4.

C is in a stately 4.

D is in 3, but the beat may be harder to feel than in A because the rhythms are

more complex and the performer is taking some liberties with the tempo (Section

Rhythm, melody, harmony, timbre, and texture are the essential aspects of a musical

performance. They are often called the basic elements of music.

The main purpose of music theory is to describe various pieces of music in terms of

their similarities and differences in these elements, and music is usually grouped into

genres based on similarities in all or most elements. It's useful, therefore, to be

familiar with the terms commonly used to describe each element. Because harmony is

the most highly developed aspect of Western music (Section 2.8), music theory tends

to focus almost exclusively on melody and harmony. Music does not have to have

harmony, however, and some music doesn't even have melody. So perhaps the other

three elements can be considered the most basic components of music.

Music cannot happen without time. The placement of the sounds in time is the rhythm

of a piece of music. Because music must be heard over a period of time, rhythm is one

of the most basic elements of music. In some pieces of music, the rhythm is simply a

"placement in time" that cannot be assigned a beat or meter, but most rhythm terms

concern more familiar types of music with a steady beat. See Meter for more on how

such music is organized, and Duration and Time Signature for more on how to read

and write rhythms. See Simple Rhythm Activities for easy ways to encourage children

to explore rhythm.

Rhythm - The term "rhythm" has more than one meaning. It can mean the basic,

repetitive pulse of the music, or a rhythmic pattern that is repeated throughout

the music (as in "feel the rhythm"). It can also refer to the pattern in time of a

single small group of notes (as in "play this rhythm for me").

Beat - Beat also has more than one meaning, but always refers to music with a steady pulse. It may refer to the pulse itself (as in "play this note on beat two of the measure"). On the beat or on the downbeat refer to the moment when the

pulse is strongest. OFF the beat is in between pulses, and the upbeat is exactly

halfway between pulses. Beat may also refer to a specific repetitive rhythmic

pattern that maintains the pulse (as in "it has a Latin beat"). Note that once a

strong feeling of having a beat is established, it is not necessary for something to

happen on every beat; a beat can still be "felt" even if it is not specifically heard.

happen on every beat; a beat can still be "felt" even if it is not specifically heard.

Measure or bar - Beats are grouped into measures or bars. The first beat is

usually the strongest, and in most music, most of the bars have the same number

of beats. This sets up an underlying pattern in the pulse of the music: for

example, strong-weak-strong-weak-strongweak, or strong-weak-weak-strong-

Rhythm Section - The rhythm section of a band is the group of instruments that

usually provide the background rhythm and chords. The rhythm section almost

always includes a percussionist (usually on a drum set) and a bass player (usually

playing a plucked string bass of some kind). It may also include a piano and/or

other keyboard players, more percussionists, and one or more guitar players or

One of the basic elements of music is called color, or timbre (pronounced "TAM-ber").

Timbre describes all of the aspects of a musical sound that do not have anything to do

with the sound's pitch, Dynamics and Accents (Page 47), or Duration: Note Lengths in

Written Music (Page 22). In other words, if a flute plays a note, and then an oboe5

plays the same note, for the same length of time, at the same loudness, you can still

easily tell the two notes apart, because a flute sounds different from an oboe. This

difference is in the timbre of the sounds.

Timbre is caused by the fact that each note from a musical instrument is a complex

wave containing more than one frequency. For instruments that produce notes with a

clear and specific pitch, the frequencies involved are part of a harmonic series. For

other instruments (such as drums), the sound wave may have an even greater variety

of frequencies. We hear each mixture of frequencies not as separate sounds, but as

the color of the sound. Small differences in the balance of the frequencies - how many

you can hear, their relationship to the fundamental pitch, and how loud they are

compared to each other - create the many different musical colors.

compared to each other - create the many different musical colors.

The harmonics at the beginning of each note - the attack - are especially important

for timbre, so it is actually easier to identify instruments that are playing short notes

with strong articulations than it is to identify instruments playing long, smooth notes.

The human ear and brain are capable of hearing and appreciating very small

variations in timbre. A listener can hear not only the difference between an oboe and

a flute, but also the difference between two different oboes. The general sound that

one would expect of a type of instrument â a trombone for example - is usually called

its timbre or color. Variations in timbre between specific instruments - two different

trombones, for example, or two different trombone players, or the same trombone

player using different types of sound in different pieces - may be called differences in

timbre or color, or may be called differences in tone or in tone quality. Tone quality

may refer specifically to "quality", as when a young trombonist is encouraged to have

a "fuller" or "more focussed" tone quality, or it can refer neutrally to differences in

sound, as when an orchestral trombonist is asked to play with a "brassy" tone quality

in one passage and a "mellow" tone quality in another.

Melody is one of the most basic elements of music. A note is a sound with a particular

pitch and duration. String a series of notes together, one after the other, and you have

a melody. But the melody of a piece of music isn't just any string of notes. It's the

notes that catch your ear as you listen; the line that sounds most important is the

melody. There are some common terms used in discussions of melody that you may

find it useful to know. First of all, the melodic line of a piece of music is the string of

notes that make up the melody. Extra notes, such as trills and slides, that are not part

of the main melodic line but are added to the melody either by the composer or the

performer to make the melody more complex and interesting are called ornaments

or embellishments. Below are some more concepts that are associated with melody.

A melody that stays on the same pitch gets boring pretty quickly. As the melody

progresses, the pitches may go up or down slowly or quickly. One can picture a line

that goes up steeply when the melody suddenly jumps to a much higher note, or that

goes down slowly when the melody gently falls. Such a line gives the contour or

shape of the melodic line. You can often get a good idea of the shape of this line by

looking at the melody as it is written on the staff, but you can also hear it as you listen

to the music.

Figure 2.1 Arch shapes (in which the melody rises and then falls) are easy to find in many melodies.

You can also describe the shape of a melody verbally. For example, you can speak of a

"rising melody" or of an "arch-shaped" phrase. Please see The Shape of a Melody for

children's activities covering melodic contour.

Another set of useful terms describe how quickly a melody goes up and down. A

melody that rises and falls slowly, with only small pitch changes between one note and

the next, is conjunct. One may also speak of such a melody in terms of step-wise or

scalar motion, since most of the intervals in the melody are half or whole steps or are

part of a scale. A melody that rises and falls quickly, with large intervals between one

note and the next, is a disjunct melody. One may also speak of "leaps" in the melody.

Many melodies are a mixture of conjunct and disjunct motion.

Figure 2.2 Mixture of conjunct and disjunct motion A melody may show conjuct motion, with small

changes in pitch from one note to the next, or disjunct motion, with large leaps. Many melodies are an

interesting, fairly balanced mixture of conjunct and disjunct motion.

Melodies are often described as being made up of phrases. A musical phrase is

actually a lot like a grammatical phrase. A phrase in a sentence (for example, "into the

deep, dark forest" or "under that heavy book") is a group of words that make sense

together and express a definite idea, but the phrase is not a complete sentence by

itself. A melodic phrase is a group of notes that make sense together and express a

definite melodic "idea", but it takes more than one phrase to make a complete

melody.

How do you spot a phrase in a melody? Just as you often pause between the different

sections in a sentence (for example, when you say, "wherever you go, there you are"),

the melody usually pauses slightly at the end of each phrase. In vocal music, the

musical phrases tend to follow the phrases and sentences of the text. For example,

listen11 to the phrases in the melody of "The Riddle Song" and see how they line up

with the four sentences in the song.

Figure 2.3 The Riddle Song This melody has four phrases, one for each sentence of the text.

But even without text, the phrases in a melody can be very clear. Even without words,

the notes are still grouped into melodic "ideas". Listen to the first strain of Scott

Joplin's "The Easy Winners" to see if you can hear four phrases in the melody.

One way that a composer keeps a piece of music interesting is by varying how strongly

the end of each phrase sounds like "the end". Usually, full-stop ends come only at the

end of the main sections of the music. (See form and cadence for more on this.) By

varying aspects of the melody, the rhythm, and the harmony, the composer gives the

ends of the other phrases stronger or weaker "ending" feelings. Often, phrases come

in definite pairs, with the first phrase feeling very unfinished until it is completed by

the second phrase, as if the second phrase were answering a question asked by the

first phrase. When phrases come in pairs like this, the first phrase is called the

antecedent phrase, and the second is called the consequent phrase. Listen to

antecedent and consequent phrases in the tune "Auld Lang Syne".

Figure 2.4 Antecedent and Consequent Phrases The rhythm of the first two phrases of "Auld Lang Syne"

is the same, but both the melody and the harmony lead the first phrase to feel unfinished until it is

answered by the second phrase. Note that both the melody and harmony of the second phrase end on the

tonic (pg 127), the "home" note and chord of the key.

Of course, melodies don't always divide into clear, separated phrases. Often the

phrases in a melody will run into each other, cut each other short, or overlap. This is

one of the things that keeps a melody interesting.

Another term that usually refers to a piece of melody (although it can also refer to a

rhythm (Section 2.1) or a chord progression (Chords)) is "motif". A motif is a short

musical idea â shorter than a phrase - that occurs often in a piece of music. A short

melodic idea may also be called a motiv, a motive, a cell, or a figure. These small

pieces of melody will appear again and again in a piece of music, sometimes exactly

the same and sometimes changed. When a motif returns, it can be slower or faster, or

in a different key. It may return "upside down" (with the notes going up instead of

down, for example), or with the pitches or rhythms altered.

a very short cell or a long phrase) is associated with a particular character, place, thing,

or idea in the opera and may be heard whenever that character is on stage or that

idea is an important part of the plot. As with other motifs, leitmotifs may be changed

when they return. For example, the same melody may sound quite different

depending on whether the character is in love, being heroic, or dying.

Counterpoint (Page 74) has more than one melody at the same time. This tends to

change the rules for using and developing melodies, so the terms used to talk about

contrapuntal melodies are different, too. For example, the melodic idea that is most

important in a fugue is called its subject. Like a motif, a subject has often changed

when it reappears, sounding higher or lower, for example, or faster or slower. For

more on the subject (pun intended), please see Counterpoint.

A longer section of melody that keeps reappearing in the music - for example, in a "theme and variations" - is often called a theme. Themes generally are at least one

phrase long and often have several phrases. Many longer works of music, such as

symphony movements, have more than one melodic theme.

Figure 2.7 Theme from Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 The tune of this theme will be very familiar to most

people, but you may want tolisten to the entire last movement of the symphony to hear the different ways

that Beethoven uses the melody again and again.

The musical scores for movies and television can also contain melodic themes, which

can be developed as they might be in a symphony or may be used very much like

operatic leitmotifs (pg 77). For example, in the music John Williams composed for the

Star Wars movies, there are melodic themes that are associated with the main

characters. These themes are often complete melodies with many phrases, but a

single phrase can be taken from the melody and used as a motif. A single phrase of

Ben Kenobi's Theme19, for example, can remind you of all the good things he stands

for, even if he is not on the movie screen at the time.

There are many informal terms that can describe the texture of a piece of music (thick,

thin, bassheavy, rhythmically complex, and so on), but the formal terms that are used

to describe texture all describe the relationships of Melody (Page 62) and Harmony

(Page 71). Here are definitions and examples of the four main types of texture. For

specific pieces of music that are good examples of each type of texture, please see

below.

Monophonic music has only one melodic line, with no harmony or counterpoint.

There may be rhythmic accompaniment, but only one line that has specific pitches.

Monophonic music can also be called monophony. It is sometimes called monody,

although the term "monody" can also refer to a particular type of solo song (with

instrumental accompaniment) that was very popular in the 1600's.

Homophonic music can also be called homophony. More informally, people who are

describing homophonic music may mention chords (Chords), accompaniment

(Accompaniment), harmony or harmonies. Homophony has one clearly melodic line;

it's the line that naturally draws your attention. All other parts provide

accompaniment or fill in the chords. In most well-written homophony, the parts that

are not melody may still have a lot of melodic interest. They may follow many of the

rules of well-written counterpoint, and they can sound quite different from the melody

and be interesting to listen to by themselves. But when they are sung or played with

Polyphonic music can also be called polyphony, counterpoint, or contrapuntal

music. If more than one independent melody is occurring at the same time, the music

is polyphonic. (See Counterpoint (Page 74).)

Music that is mostly homophonic can become temporarily polyphonic if an

independent countermelody is added. Think of a favorite pop or gospel tune that,

near the end, has the soloist "ad libbing" while the back-up singers repeat the

refrain.

A heterophonic texture is rare in Western music. In heterophony, there is only one

melody, but different variations of it are being sung or played at the same time.

Heterophony can be heard in the Bluegrass, "mountain music", Cajun, and

Zydeco traditions. Listen for the tune to be played by two instruments (say fiddle

and banjo) at the same time, with each adding the embellishments, ornaments,

and flourishes that are characteristic of the instrument.

Some Middle Eastern, South Asian, central Eurasian, and Native American music

traditions include heterophony. Listen for traditional music (most modern-

composed music, even from these cultures, has little or no heterophony) in which

singers and/or instrumentalists perform the same melody at the same time, but

lines, you can hear the relationship of any notes that

happen at the same time, and it is this relationship that makes the harmony.

Note: Harmony does not have to be particularly "harmonious"; it may be quite

dissonant, in fact. For the purpose of definitions, the important fact is the

notes sounding at the same time.

Harmony is the most emphasized and most highly developed element in Western

music, and can be the subject of an entire course on music theory. Many of the

concepts underlying

Western harmony are explained in greater detail elsewhere (see Triads and Beginning Harmonic Analysis, for example), but here are some basic terms and short definitions

that you may find useful in discussions of harmony:

implied harmony - A melody all by itself (Monophony) can have an implied

harmony, even if no other notes are sounding at the same time. In other words,

the melody can be constructed so that it strongly suggests a harmony that could

accompany it. For example, when you sing a melody by itself, you may be able to

"hear" in your mind the chords that usually go with it. A Bach unaccompanied

cello suite also has strongly implied harmonies; if someone really wanted to play

an accompaniment (Accompaniment), the appropriate chords (Chords) could be

found pretty easily. But some melodies don't imply any harmony; they are not

meant to be played with harmony, and don't need it to be legitimate music. (Good

examples of this include plainchant, some modern art music, and some Non-

drones - The simplest way to add harmony to a melody is to play it with drones. A

drone is a note that changes rarely or not at all. Drones can be most easily found in bagpipes music, Indian Classical music and other musics that use instruments

that traditionally play drone notes. (See Harmony with Drones.)

parallel harmony - Parallel harmony occurs when different lines in the music go

up or down together (usually following the melody). (See Parallel Harmonies for

examples.)

chords - In Western music, most harmony is based on chords. Chords are groups

of notes built on major or minor triads. In traditional triadic chords, there are

always at least three notes in a chord (there can be more than three), but some of

the notes may be left out and only "implied" by the harmony. The notes of the

chord may be played at the same time (block chords), or may overlap, or may be

played separately but in a quick enough succession that they will be "heard" as a

chord (arpeggiated chords).

cadence- A cadence is a point where the music feels as if it has come to a

temporary or permanent stopping point. In most Western music, cadence is tied

very strongly to the harmony. For example, most listeners will feel that the

strongest, most satisfying ending to a piece of music involves a dominant chord

followed by a tonic chord. In fact, a song that does not end on the tonic chord will

sound quite unsettled and even unfinished to most listeners. (See Cadence (Page

177).)

inner parts or inner voices - Accompaniment parts that fill in the music in

between the melody (which is often the highest part) and the bass line.

descant - The melody is not always the highest line in the music. Attention is

naturally drawn to high notes, so a part that is higher than the melody is

sometimes given a special name such as "descant". This term is an old one going

all the way back to when harmonies first began to be added to medieval chant.

Counterpoint is an important element of music, but it is not one of the basic elements.

Many pieces of music have rhythm, melody, harmony, color, and texture, but no real

counterpoint. In fact, when describing the texture of a piece of music, two of the most

important questions that need to be addressed are: is there counterpoint, and how

important is it?

When there is more than one independent melodic line happening at the same time in

a piece of music, we say that the music is contrapuntal. The independent melodic

lines are called counterpoint. The music that is made up of counterpoint can also be

called polyphony, or one can say that the music is polyphonic or speak of the

polyphonic texture of the music. Traditionally, vocal music is more likely to be

described as polyphony and instrumental music is more likely to be described as

counterpoint. But all of these terms refer to two or more independent, simultaneous

counterpoint. But all of these terms refer to two or more independent, simultaneous

melodies. "Simultaneous" means the melodies are happening at the same time. "Independent" means that at any given moment what is happening in one melody

(both in the rhythms and in the pitches) is probably not the same thing that is

happening in the other melody.

First, some examples of music that is not counterpoint. Obviously, there is no

counterpoint if there is no melody at all. If there is one melodic line accompanied only

by rhythm, or drones, or only by chords, there is no counterpoint.

Even if different people are singing or playing different parts, it is not necessarily

considered counterpoint if the parts are not independent enough, or if one of the

parts is very clearly a dominating melody. Many traditional choral pieces are a good

example of this. There are four very different singing parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and

example of this. There are four very different singing parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and

bass), and each part, sung alone, can seem like its own melody, a melody that does

not sound at all like the melody of the piece. But the parts have basically the same

rhythms, so that the effect, when sung together, is of chords being sung.

"Barbershop"-style music is another good example of this homophonic, or chordal,

kind of texture, which is not considered counterpoint. Now for some familiar

examples of counterpoint. One of the simplest and most familiar types of

counterpoint is the round. In a round, everyone sings the same melody, but they start

singing it at different times. Although everyone is singing exactly the same tune, at any

particular time different people will be singing different parts of it, so the final effect is

of independent parts. You may also have heard some Bach fugues or inventions; there

of independent parts. You may also have heard some Bach fugues or inventions; there

are no better examples of counterpoint than these. Another example that may be

familiar is the soloist in a pop or gospel song who, after the refrain has been repeated

a few times, takes off on a countermelody or descant part while everyone else

continues to sing the refrain. The melody instruments in a dixieland band are also

generally playing independent parts, giving this genre its "busy" sound. In fact, when

music sounds very "busy" or "complex" or when there is so much going on that it gets

difficult to decide where the melody is or what part to sing along with, it is likely that

you are hearing counterpoint.

Although there is plenty of music that has no counterpoint, independent parts are one

of the most basic ways to make music sound rich and interesting. Even if a piece of

music cannot really be called "counterpoint" or "polyphony", because it clearly has one

(Accompaniment) lines may still be quite contrapuntal. Even music that most people

would describe as homophonic or chordal (Chords), because all the lines have exactly

the same rhythm, is often written following the voice-leading rules of counterpoint.

This gives the music a much richer, more interesting texture. Next time you are

listening to your favorite song or your favorite piece of music, don't hum along with

the melody. Instead, listen to the bass line. Listen to the harmonies, the inner voices

(Accompaniment) and the instrumental accompaniment parts. Chances are that you

will hear some interesting lines, even little pieces of melody, that are completely

different from the part you normally hear.

Countermelody or descant - Sometimes a piece of music that is basically melody-

with accompaniment (homophonic) will include a single part that is truly

independent of the melody. For example, a choral piece might be chordal for a

few verses and then, to keep the music interesting and fresh, add an independent

part for a flute or for the highest sopranos on the third verse. This is a

countermelody, sometimes called a descant part. Gospel and pop singers often

add countermelodies, sometimes imrovised, and classical music also contains

many, many examples of countermelodies.

The range of a voice or instrument is the set of pitches, from lowest to highest, that it

can sing or play. A range can be described using the appropriate octave identification,

for example, "from one-line c to two-line g". But it is often easiest to write the range on

a staff, as the two notes at the high and low ends of the range.

A piece of music, or one performer's part in that piece, may also be described as

having a range, from the lowest to highest note written for the performer in that

piece. There is usually a difference (sometimes a large one) between the total range of

the part and a smaller range that the part stays in most of the time (heading to the

extreme highs and lows only occasionally). This smaller range is called the tessitura of

the part. One can also speak of the tessitura of a performer's voice, which is the

range in which it sounds the best (so that matching the tessitura of the part and of the performer is a very good idea). Notice the similarity between this second definition

and the term power range (pg 89), sometimes used to describe the most powerful or

useful part of an instrument's range.

A register is a distinctive part of a vocal or instrumental range. For example, singers

may speak of the head register, in the upper part of their range, and the chest

register in the lower part of their range. These two registers sound and feel very

different, and the singer may have even have two distinct tessituras, one in each

register. The large range of the clarinet39 is also divided into distinctive registers with

different capabilities and very different timbres. Even when an instrument does not

have a very large variation in timbre over its range, its players may speak of the

difficulty of "playing in the high register" or a "dull timbre in the low register".

into higher or lower voices. Most voices can be assigned one of these four ranges, and

this gives the composer four vocal lines to work with, which is usually enough. The

four main vocal ranges are:

Soprano -- A high female (or boy's) voice

Alto -- A low female (or boy's) voice

Tenor -- A high (adult) male voice

Bass -- A low (adult) male voice

Arrangements for these four voices are labelled SATB (for Soprano Alto Tenor Bass).

The ranges of the four voices overlap, but singers may find themselves straining or

getting an unpleasant sound at the top or a weak sound at the bottom of their ranges.

So although the full ranges of an alto and a soprano may look quite similar, the

soprano gets a strong, clear sound on the higher notes, and the alto a strong, clear

sound in the lower part of the range. But there are vocalists whose strong, best-

sounding range falls in a distinctly different place from any of these four voices. The

names for some of these ranges are:

saxophone sounds higher than a tenor saxophone. Some other terms that are used to

describe instrument ranges are:

Contra - Means lower: for example a contrabassoon sounds lower than a regular

bassoon, and a contrabass clarinet is even lower than a bass clarinet.

higher than a regular trumpet.

A Note Name - If an instrument comes in several different sizes (and ranges), the

name of a particular size of the instrument may be a note name: for example, an F horn, a B flat clarinet, and a C trumpet. The note name is the name of the

fundamental harmonic of the instrument. An instrument with a slightly higher

fundamental will have a slightly higher range; an instrument with a much lower

fundamental will have a much lower range. Some instruments that are identified

this way are transposing instruments47, but others are not.

The ranges of some instruments are definite and absolute. For example, even a

beginning piano player can play the highest and lowest keys; and even the best player

cannot play beyond these. But the ranges of many instruments are, like vocal ranges,

not so definite. For example, an experienced horn or clarinet player can play much

higher and lower notes than a beginner. An exceptional trumpet player may be able to

indefinite ranges. For example, on any string instrument, nobody can play lower than

the note that the lowest string is tuned to. But experienced players can easily play very

high notes that inexperienced players have trouble playing well. So it is sometimes

useful to distinguish between a possible range, which includes the notes that a very

experienced player can get, and a practical range, that includes all the notes that any

competent player (including a good younger player) can get.

Note: Outside of the instrument's practical range, it may be a strain for even a

very good player to play long or tricky passages. So if you are composing or

arranging, it's a very good idea to be able to distinguish between these two

ranges for the voices or instruments you include.

Some sources even list the power range of an instrument or voice. This is the part of

the range where the instrument or voice is particularly strong. It may be in the middle

the range where the instrument or voice is particularly strong. It may be in the middle

of the range, or at the top or bottom, but writing in the power range should guarantee

that the part is easy to play (or sing), sounds clear and strong, and can be easily heard,

even when many other instruments are playing.

One of the first things needed when you begin the study of any subject is a little

introduction to the "lingo." Since music is such a huge subject, some of the words used

to talk about it are the terms that divide it up into smaller subjects, the way science is

divided into biology, physics, and so on. So here are a few terms that may be useful if

you are wondering what kind of music you want to learn more about.

Most of the music books you'll find on the shelf are about Western music. From the

end of the Middle Ages to modern times, composers and performers in western Europe gradually developed widely accepted standards for tuning, melody, harmony,

meter , notation, form, counterpoint and other music basics. These rules are a sort of

grammar for the language of music. Just as the basic rules for putting together

sentences and paragraphs help people understand each other, knowing what to

expect from a piece of music helps people understand and like it.

Of course, music, like language, changes through the centuries. A Bach invention, a

Brahms symphony, and a Beatles song are different forms in different genres, and at

first they may sound as if they have nothing in common. But they all use the same

musical "language" and follow basically the same rules. They are all examples of

Western music, and are all more like each other than they are like a Navajo lullaby, a

Wherever Europeans went during the colonial era, they took their music with them.

So, in places like Australia and the Americas, not only do most of the people speak

European languages, much of their music also sounds Western. What are the rules of

this European musical language? A complete answer to that question would be long

and complex, since Western music, like any living language shared by many different

communities, has many "local dialects". The short answer is: Western music is

generally tonal , based on major or minor scales, using an equal temperament tuning,

in an easy-to-recognize meter , with straightforward rhythms, fairly strict rules on

harmony and counterpoint, and not much improvisation. This is, of course, a huge

generalization. Twentieth century art music, in particular, was very interested in

breaking down or even rejecting these rules.

But because they are flexible enough to allow plenty of interesting but easy-to-grasp

music, the rules are still widely used, particularly in popular music. In fact, the use of

these traditional rules for Western music is now so widespread that it is sometimes

called common practice. They are what makes Western music sound familiar and

easy to understand.

Non-Western music is any music that grew out of a different culture or musical

tradition than the European. For someone who grew up listening to Western music,

Non-Western music will have a recognizably exotic sound. This comes from the use of

different tuning systems, different scales, different vocal styles and performance

practices, and different approaches to melody and harmony.

Note: You may find the terms "Western" and "Non-Western" to be too

Eurocentric, but they are very well entrenched, so you'll need to know what

they mean. If you want to avoid using the terms yourself, you can be more

specific. You can speak, for example, of European classical or the European-

American folk tradition, as opposed to Indian Classical49, Japanese folk, or

African-American musics.

Much of the music that is popular today cannot really be classified as completely

Western or Non- Western. Since colonial times, when European cultures came into

contact with many Non-Western cultures, musicians on all sides have been

experimenting with music that is a blend of "the best of both worlds." Many musical

styles have been invented that mixWestern and Non-Western traditions.

Perhaps the oldest and most widely popular of these styles are the ones that join

European and African musical traditions. These include various Latin (from Central

and South America, some of which also include Native American influences) and

Caribbean traditions, and from North America, many different kinds of jazz and

Medieval European music, like many Non-Western traditions, was modal. This means

that a piece of music was not in a particular key based on a major or minor scale.

Instead, it was in a particular mode. A mode may look very much like a scale, since it

lists the notes that are "allowed" in the piece of music and defines the tonic of the

music. But a mode is usually also a collection of melodies, melodic phrases, or

patterns that are found in that mode and not others (since the various modes are

more different from each other than the various scales). Modes also may imply or

suggest specific moods or they may be meant to have particular effects on the

character of the listener.

Different keys may also evoke different moods, but the main purpose of a key is to

From the Renaissance to the present day, most Western music has tended to be tonal. Tonal music is music in which the progression of the melody and harmony gives the

strong feeling that the piece has a note and chord that are its "home base", so to

speak (the tonic of the key). Think of a very familiar tune, perhaps "Row, Row, Row

your Boat" or "Happy Birthday to You". Imagine how frustrating it would be to end

that tune without singing the last note or playing the final chord.

If you did this, most people would be so dissatisfied that they might supply that last

note for you.

That note is the tonal center of the tune, and without it, there is a feeling that the song

has not reached its proper resting place. In tonal music, just about any melody is

allowed, as long as it fits into the harmonies as they wander away from and then head

back to their home base. Most Western tonal music is based on major and minor

others, such as whole-tone scales, do not.

Most of the Western music that is popular today is tonal, but around the beginning of

the twentieth century, composers of "Classical" or Art music (see below) began

experimenting with methods of composing atonal music. "Atonal" literally means "not

tonal". As the name implies, atonal music treats all notes and harmonies as equal and

in fact tries to avoid melodies and harmonies that will make the piece sound tonal.

One type of atonal music is twelve-tone music, which seeks to use each of the notes of

the chromatic scale (pg 123) equally. Other pieces may even dispense with the idea

that music has to consist of notes; compositions may be collections of sounds and

silences. Since the music is not organized by the familiar rules of Western music, many

people have trouble appreciating atonal music without some help or study.

Music can be more or less tonal without becoming completely atonal, however. Music

Music can be more or less tonal without becoming completely atonal, however. Music

that does not stray at all from its key is called diatonic. Many Western children's

songs, folk songs, and pop songs are in this category. But composers often add some

notes or even whole sections of music that are from a different key, to make the music

a little more complex and interesting. Music that goes even further, and freely uses all

the notes of the chromatic scale (pg 123), but still manages to have a tonal "home", is

called chromatic. Music that has more than one tonal center at the same time (Ives

was particularly fond of this composition technique) is called polytonal.

Popular music is, by definition, music that appeals to many people. You don't have to

know anything about music to like a pop tune - it's "catchy". Art music is a catch-all

term for any music that is enjoyed by a smaller crowd. This can include the more

challenging types of jazz and rock music, as well as Classical. Most people agree that

the appreciation of art music requires some study, careful listening, or other extra

effort. But it can be harder to agree on what exactly belongs in this category. This is at

least partly because popular tastes do change. For example, most operas were written

to be popular, middle-class entertainments, and artists such as Liszt and Paganini enjoyed rock-star-like fame and popularity in their day. Today, however, nineteenth

century operas are no longer considered popular entertainment, and popular works

that could technically be considered opera - except for the fact that they are written in

popular musical styles - are instead grouped with musicals. As another example,

and was known only to some jazz connoisseurs. Then in the 1970's it became popular

again.

Classical music is a confusing term with more than one meaning. In the visual arts,

the term classical refers to ancient Greece and Rome. In the 1700's, Western

Europeans became very interested in the ancient classical style, which was imitated by

many artists, sculptors, and architects.

Art historians call that period the neoclassical ("new classical"). Unfortunately,

nobody really knows what the music of ancient times sounded like. So instead of

being influenced by the sound of ancient Greek music, eighteenth-century composers

were influenced by the ideals of classical art.

The music of Mozart, Haydn, and the early works of Beethoven are in this style, which

we call classical rather than neoclassical, because the original classical music of

ancient Greece and Rome is lost. (And actually, it probably would sound very exotic

and Non-Western to us if we could listen to it!)

So the original classical music comes from one fairly short era. The other great

composers of Western music lived during other periods: Bach and Handel were

Baroque era composers, for example; Brahms and Wagner, Romantic52; and Ravel

and Debussy, Impressionist. But most people do not know which music is from which

The terms "folk music" and "pop music" also have more than one meaning. The folk

music of a culture is the music that is passed down from one generation to the next,

often without writing it down. It includes many different kinds of music: lullabies and

children's singing games, tunes that everyone enjoys singing together or dancing to,

songs for celebrations, ceremonies, and holidays. Folk music can gradually change as

it gets passed along. Usually nobody remembers who originally wrote it, or who

changed it, and there may be more than one version of any particular folk song. Since

ancient times, folk music has been the music of ordinary people, not the ruling class

or professional musicians. In every culture, children learned and remembered the

music that everyone enjoyed the most, and the music that was important to their

traditions.

The modern recording industry has changed things, though. In many cultures, pop

music has largely replaced folk music as the music that everyone knows. Unlike folk

music, it has usually been written recently and belongs to professional musicians, and

new popular tunes quickly replace old ones. Even the types of music that are

considered popular can change quickly. The term pop music can refer to a specific

kind of popular music, as in "bubblegum pop". Popular music is also a general term

for any type of music that is or has been a top seller. This includes most types of rock

music and some kinds of jazz.

As the rise of recording pushed aside traditional music, some musicians made a point

In the modal music category, medieval chant and the classical music of India are

easiest to find.

with the work of composers who stayed with some sort of tonality (Ralph

Music is sound that's organized by people on purpose, to dance to, to tell a story, to

make other people feel a certain way, or just to sound pretty or be entertaining. Music

is organized on many different levels. Sounds can be arranged into melodies,

harmonies, rhythms, textures and phrases. Beats, measures, cadences , and form all

help to keep the music organized and understandable. But the most basic way that

music is organized is by arranging the actual sound waves themselves so that the

sounds are interesting and pleasant and go well together.

A rhythmic, organized set of thuds and crashes is perfectly good music - think of your

favorite drum solo - but many musical instruments are designed specifically to

produce the regular, evenly spaced sound waves that we hear as particular pitches.

Crashes, thuds, and bangs are loud, short jumbles of lots of different wavelengths.

These are the kinds of sound we often call "noise", when they're random and

These are the kinds of sound we often call "noise", when they're random and

disorganized, but as soon as they are organized in time (rhythm), they begin to sound

like music. (When used as a scientific term, noise refers to continuous sounds that are

random mixtures of different wavelengths, not shorter crashes and thuds.)

However, to get the melodic kind of sounds more often associated with music, the

sound waves must themselves be organized and regular, not random mixtures. Most

of the sounds we hear are brought to our ears through the air. A movement of an

object causes a disturbance of the normal motion of the air molecules near the object.

Those molecules in turn disturb other nearby molecules out of their normal patterns

of random motion, so that the disturbance itself becomes a thing that moves through

the air - a sound wave. If the movement of the object is a fast, regular vibration, then

the sound waves are also very regular. We hear such regular sound waves as tones, sounds with a particular pitch. It is this kind of sound that we most often associate

with music, and that many musical instruments are designed to make.

Figure 3.1 A random jumble of sound waves is heard as a noise. A regular, evenly-spaced sound wave

is heard as a tone.

Musicians have terms that they use to describe tones. (Musicians also have other

meanings for the word "tone", but this course will stick to the "a sound with pitch"

meaning.) This kind of (regular, evenly spaced) wave is useful for things other than

music, however, so scientists and engineers also have terms that describe pitched

sound waves. As we talk about where music theory comes from, it will be very useful

to know both the scientific and the musical terms and how they are related to each

other.

sounds. Musicians talk about the pitch of the sound, or name specific notes, or talk

things, but talking about them in slightly different ways, and using the scientific ideas

So what are we talking about when we speak of sound waves? Waves are

disturbances; they are changes in something - the surface of the ocean, the air,

electromagnetic fields. Normally, these changes are travelling (except for standing

waves (Section 3.2)); the disturbance is moving away from whatever created it, in a

kind of domino effect.

Most kinds of waves are transverse waves. In a transverse wave, as the wave is

moving in one direction, it is creating a disturbance in a different direction. The most

familiar example of this is waves on the surface of water. As the wave travels in one

direction - say south - it is creating an up-and-down (not north-and-south) motion on

the water's surface. This kind of wave is fairly easy to draw; a line going from left-to-

right has up-and-down wiggles. (See Figure 3.2 below)

downs are in a different direction from the forward movement of the wave. The "highs and lows" of sound

waves and other longitudinal waves are arranged in the "forward" direction.

But sound waves are not transverse. Sound waves are longitudinal waves. If sound

waves are moving south, the disturbance that they are creating is giving the air

molecules extra north-and south (not east-and-west, or up-and-down) motion. If the disturbance is from a regular vibration, the result is that the molecules end up

squeezed together into evenly-spaced waves. This is very difficult to show clearly in a

diagram, so most diagrams, even diagrams of sound waves, show transverse waves.

Longitudinal waves may also be a little difficult to imagine, because there aren't any

examples that we can see in everyday life (unless you like to play with toy slinkies). A

mathematical description might be that in longitudinal waves, the waves (the

mathematical description might be that in longitudinal waves, the waves (the

disturbances) are along the same axis as the direction of motion of the wave;

transverse waves are at right angles to the direction of motion of the wave. If this

doesn't help, try imagining yourself as one of the particles that the wave is disturbing

(a water drop on the surface of the ocean, or an air molecule). As it comes from

behind you, a transverse waves lifts you up and then drops down; a longitudinal wave

coming from behind pushes you forward and pulls you back. You can view here

animations of longitudinal and transverse waves, single particles being disturbed by a

transverse wave or by a longitudinal wave, and particles being disturbed by transverse

and longitudinal waves. (There were also some nice animations of longitudinal waves

available as of this writing at Musemath.)

The result of these "forward and backward" waves is that the "high point" of a sound

wave is where the air molecules are bunched together, and the "low point" is where

there are fewer air molecules. In a pitched sound, these areas of bunched molecules

are very evenly spaced. In fact, they are so even, that there are some very useful

things we can measure and say about them. In order to clearly show you what they

are, most of the diagrams in this course will show sound waves as if they are

transverse waves.

Both transverse and longitudinal waves cause a displacement of something: air

molecules, for example, or the surface of the ocean. The amount of displacement at

any particular spot changes as the wave passes. If there is no wave, or if the spot is in

the same state it would be in if there was no wave, there is no displacement.

Displacement is biggest (furthest from "normal") at the highest and lowest points of

the wave. In a sound wave, then, there is no displacement wherever the air molecules

are at a normal density. The most displacement occurs wherever the molecules are

the most crowded or least crowded.

The amplitude of the wave is a measure of the displacement: how big is the change

from no displacement to the peak of a wave? Are the waves on the lake two inches

high or two feet? Are the air molecules bunched very tightly together, with very empty

spaces between the waves, or are they barely more organized than they would be in

their normal course of bouncing off of each other?

Scientists measure the amplitude of sound waves in decibels. Leaves rustling in the

wind are about 10 decibels; a jet engine is about 120 decibels.

Musicians call the loudness of a note its dynamic level. Forte (pronounced "FOR-tay")

is a loud dynamic level; piano is soft. Dynamic levels don't correspond to a measured

decibel level. An orchestra playing "fortissimo" (which basically means "even louder

than forte") is going to be quite a bit louder than a string quartet playing "fortissimo".

The aspect of evenly-spaced sound waves that really affects music theory is the

spacing between the waves, the distance between, for example, one high point and

the next high point. This is the wavelength, and it affects the pitch of the sound; the

closer together the waves are, the higher the tone sounds.

All sound waves are travelling at about the same speed - the speed of sound. So

waves with a shorter wavelength arrive (at your ear, for example) more often

This aspect of a sound - how often a peak of a wave goes by, is called frequency by

scientists and engineers. They measure it in hertz, which is how many peaks go by per

second. People can hear sounds that range from about 20 to about 17,000 hertz.

Figure 3.4 Wavelength, Frequency, and Pitch Since the sounds are travelling at about the same speed,

the one with the shorter wavelength "waves" more frequently; it has a higher frequency, or pitch. In other

words, it sounds higher.

The word that musicians use for frequency is pitch. The shorter the wavelength, the

higher the frequency, and the higher the pitch, of the sound. In other words, short

waves sound high; long waves sound low. Instead of measuring frequencies,

musicians name the pitches that they use most often. They might call a note "middle

C" or "second line G" or "the F sharp in the bass clef". (See Octaves and Diatonic Music

frequencies (Have you heard of the "A 440" that is used as a tuning note?), but the

actual frequency of a middle C can vary a little from one orchestra, piano, or

performance, to another, so musicians usually find it more useful to talk about note

names.

The human ear can easily distinguish two pitches that are only one hertz apart when it

hears them both, but it is the very rare musician who can hear specifically that a note

is 442 hertz rather than 440. So why should we bother talking about frequency, when

musicians usually don't? As we will see, the physics of sound waves - and especially

frequency - affects the most basic aspects of music, including pitch, tuning,

Musical tones are produced by musical instruments, or by the voice, which, from a

physics perspective, is a very complex wind instrument. So the physics of music is the

physics of the kinds of sounds these instruments can make. What kinds of sounds are

these? They are tones caused by standing waves produced in or on the instrument. So

the properties of these standing waves, which are always produced in very specific

groups, or series, have far-reaching effects on music theory.

Most sound waves, including the musical sounds that actually reach our ears, are not

standing waves. Normally, when something makes a wave, the wave travels outward,

gradually spreading out and losing strength, like the waves moving away from a

pebble dropped into a pond.

But when the wave encounters something, it can bounce (reflection) or be bent

(refraction). In fact, you can "trap" waves by making them bounce back and forth

between two or more surfaces.

Why are trapped waves useful for music? Any bunch of sound waves will produce

some sort of noise. But to be a tone - a sound with a particular pitch - a group of

sound waves has to be very regular, all exactly the same distance apart. That's why we

can talk about the frequency (pg 99) and wavelength (pg 99) of tones.

Figure 3.5 Noise and Tone A noise is a jumble of sound waves. A tone is a very regular set of waves, all the

same size and same distance apart.

So how can you produce a tone? Let's say you have a sound wave trap (for now, don't

worry about what it looks like), and you keep sending more sound waves into it.

Picture a lot of pebbles being dropped into a very small pool. As the waves start

reffecting off the edges of the pond, they interfere with the new waves, making a

jumble of waves that partly cancel each other out and mostly just roils the pond -

noise.

But what if you could arrange the waves so that reffecting waves, instead of cancelling

out the new waves, would reinforce them? The high parts of the reffected waves

would meet the high parts of the oncoming waves and make them even higher. The

low parts of the reffected waves would meet the low parts of the oncoming waves and

make them even lower. Instead of a roiled mess of waves cancelling each other out,

you would have a pond of perfectly ordered waves, with high points and low points

appearing regularly at the same spots again and again. To help you imagine this, here

are animations of a single wave reffecting back and forth8 and standing waves.

This sort of orderliness is actually hard to get from water waves, but relatively easy to

get in sound waves, so that several completely different types of sound wave

"containers" have been developed into musical instruments. The two most common -

strings and hollow tubes - will be discussed below, but first let's finish discussing what

makes a good standing wave container, and how this affects music theory.

In order to get the necessary constant reinforcement, the container has to be the

perfect size (length) for a certain wavelength, so that waves bouncing back or being

produced at each end reinforce each other, instead of interfering with each other and

cancelling each other out. And it really helps to keep the container very narrow, so

that you don't have to worry about waves bouncing off the sides and complicating

things. So you have a bunch of regularly-spaced waves that are trapped, bouncing

back and forth in a container that fits their wavelength perfectly. If you could watch

these waves, it would not even look as if they are traveling back and forth. Instead,

these waves, it would not even look as if they are traveling back and forth. Instead,

waves would seem to be appearing and disappearing regularly at exactly the same

spots, so these trapped waves are called standing waves.

Note: Although standing waves are harder to get in water, the phenomenon

does apparently happen very rarely in lakes, resulting in freak disasters. You

can sometimes get the same effect by pushing a tub of water back and forth,

but this is a messy experiment; you'll know you are getting a standing wave

when the water suddenly starts sloshing much higher - right out of the tub!

For any narrow "container" of a particular length, there are plenty of possible standing

waves that don't fit. But there are also many standing waves that do fit. The longest wave that fits it is called the fundamental. It is also called the first harmonic. The

next longest wave that fits is the second harmonic, or the first overtone. The next

Figure 3.6 Standing Wave Harmonics There is a whole set of standing waves, called harmonics, that will fit

into any "container" of a specific length. This set of waves is called a harmonic series.

Notice that it doesn't matter what the length of the fundamental is; the waves in the

second harmonic must be half the length of the first harmonic; that's the only way

they'll both "fit". The waves of the third harmonic must be a third the length of the first

harmonic, and so on. This has a direct effect on the frequency and pitch of harmonics,

and so it affects the basics of music tremendously. To find out more about these

subjects, please see Frequency, Wavelength, and Pitch10, Harmonic Series, or Musical

Intervals, Frequency, and Ratio.

You may have noticed an interesting thing in the animation (pg 101) of standing

waves: there are spots where the "water" goes up and down a great deal, and other

spots where the "water level" doesn't seem to move at all. All standing waves have places, called nodes, where there is no wave motion, and antinodes, where the wave

is largest. It is the placement of the nodes that determines which wavelengths "fit" into

a musical instrument "container".

Figure 3.7 Nodes and Antinodes As a standing wave waves back and forth (from the red to the blue

position), there are some spots called nodes that do not move at all; basically there is no change, no waving

up- and-down (or back-and-forth), at these spots. The spots at the biggest part of the wave â where there is

the most change during each wave - are called antinodes.

One "container" that works very well to produce standing waves is a thin, very taut

string that is held tightly in place at both ends. (There were some nice animations of

waves on strings available as of this writing at Musemath.) Since the string is taut, it

vibrates quickly, producing sound waves, if you pluck it, or rub it with a bow. Since it is

held tightly at both ends, that means there has to be a node (pg 103) at each end of

the string. Instruments that produce sound using strings are called chordophones14,

or simply strings.

Figure 3.8 Standing Waves on a String A string that's held very tightly at both ends can only vibrate at very

particular wavelengths. The whole string can vibrate back and forth. It can vibrate in halves, with a node at

the middle of the string as well as each end, or in thirds, fourths, and so on. But any wavelength that doesn't

have a node at each end of the string, can't make a standing wave on the string. To get any of those other

wavelengths, you need to change the length of the vibrating string. That is what happens when the player

holds the string down with a finger, changing the vibrating length of the string and changing where the

nodes are.

The fundamental wave is the one that gives a string its pitch. But the string is making

all those other possible vibrations, too, all at the same time, so that the actual

vibration of the string is pretty complex. The other vibrations (the ones that basically

divide the string into halves, thirds and so on) produce a whole series of harmonics.

We don't hear the harmonics as separate notes, but we do hear them. They are what

gives the string its rich, musical, string-like sound - its timbre. (The sound of a single

frequency alone is a much more mechanical, uninteresting, and unmusical sound.) To

find out more about harmonics and how they affect a musical sound, see Harmonic

Series.

The string disturbs the air molecules around it as it vibrates, producing sound waves

in the air. But another great container for standing waves actually holds standing

waves of air inside a long, narrow tube. This type of instrument is called an

aerophone, and the most well-known of this type of instrument are often called wind

instruments because, although the instrument itself does vibrate a little, most of the

sound is produced by standing waves in the column of air inside the instrument.

If it is possible, have a reed player and a brass player demonstrate to you the sounds

that their mouthpieces make without the instrument. This will be a much "noisier"

sound, with lots of extra frequencies in it that don't sound very musical. But, when you

put the mouthpiece on an instrument shaped like a tube, only some of the sounds the

mouthpiece makes are the right length for the tube. Because of feedback from the

that are just the right length to become standing waves in the instrument, and the

The standing waves in a wind instrument are a little different from a vibrating string.

The wave on a string is a transverse wave, moving the string back and forth, rather

than moving up and down along the string. But the wave inside a tube, since it is a

sound wave already, is a longitudinalwave; the waves do not go from side to side in

the tube. Instead, they form along the length of the tube.

The harmonics of wind instruments are also a little more complicated, since there are

two basic shapes (cylindrical and conical) that are useful for wind instruments, and

they have different properties. The standing-wave tube of a wind instrument also may

be open at both ends, or it may be closed at one end (for a mouthpiece, for example),

and this also affects the instrument.

Please see Standing Waves in Wind Instruments if you want more information on that

subject.

For the purposes of understanding music theory, however, the important thing about

standing waves in winds is this: the harmonic series they produce is essentially the

same as the harmonic series on a string. In other words, the second harmonic is still

half the length of the fundamental, the third harmonic is one third the length, and so

on. (Actually, for reasons explained in Standing Waves in Wind Instruments, some

harmonics are "missing" in some wind instruments, but this mainly affects the timbre

(Section 2.2) and some aspects of playing the instrument. It does not affect the basic

relationships in the harmonic series.)

So far we have looked at two of the four main groups of musical instruments:

chordophones and aerophones. That leaves membranophones and idiophones.

Membranophones are instruments in which the sound is produced by making a

membrane vibrate; drums are the most familiar example. Most drums do not produce

tones; they produce rhythmic "noise" (bursts of irregular waves). Some drums do have

pitch, due to complex-patterned standing waves on the membrane that are reinforced

in the space inside the drum. This works a little bit like the waves in tubes, above, but

the waves produced on membranes, though very interesting, are too complex to be

discussed here.

Idiophones are instruments in which the body of the instrument itself, or a part of it,

produces the original vibration. Some of these instruments (cymbals, for example)

produce simple noiselike sounds when struck. But in some, the shape of the

produce simple noiselike sounds when struck. But in some, the shape of the

instrument - usually a tube, block, circle, or bell shape - allows the instrument to ring

with a standing-wave vibration when you strike it.

The standing waves in these carefully-shaped-and-sized idiophones - for example, the

blocks on a xylophone - produce pitched tones, but again, the patterns of standing

waves in these instruments are a little too complicated for this discussion. If a

percussion instrument does produce pitched sounds, however, the reason, again, is

that it is mainly producing harmonic-series overtones.

Note: Although percussion specializes in "noise"-type sounds, even

instruments like snare drums follow the basic physics rule of "bigger

instrument makes longer wavelengths and lower sounds". If you can, listen to

a percussion player or section that is using snare drums, cymbals, or other

percussion of the same type but different sizes. Can you hear the difference

Some idiophones, like gongs, ring at many different pitches when they are struck. Like

most drums, they don't have a particular pitch, but make more of a "noise"-type

particular frequencies. Can you think of some other percussion instruments that get

particular pitches? (Some can get enough different pitches to play a tune.)

Have you ever wondered how a trumpet plays so many different notes with only three

valves, or how a bugle plays different notes with no valves at all? Have you ever

wondered why an oboe and a flute sound so different, even when they're playing the

same note? What is a string player doing when she plays "harmonics"? Why do some

notes sound good together while other notes seem to clash with each other? The

answers to all of these questions have to do with the harmonic series.

of the sound waves, the higher the pitch is. But musical sounds don't have just one

frequency. Sounds that have only one frequency are not very interesting or pretty.

They have no more musical color than the beeping of a watch alarm. On the other

hand, sounds that have too many frequencies, like the sound of glass breaking or of

ocean waves crashing on a beach, may be interesting and even pleasant. But they

don't have a particular pitch, so they usually aren't considered musical notes.

When someone plays or sings a musical tone, only a very particular set of frequencies

is heard. Each note that comes out of the instrument is actually a smooth mixture of

many different pitches. These different pitches are called harmonics, and they are

blended together so well that you do not hear them as separate notes at all. Instead,

the harmonics give the note its color.

What is the color of a sound? Say an oboe plays a middle C. Then a flute plays the

same note at the same dynamic level as the oboe. It is still easy to tell the two notes

apart, because an oboe sounds different from a flute. This difference in the sounds is

the color, or timbre (pronounced "TAM-ber") of the notes. Like a color you see, the

color of a sound can be bright and bold or deep and rich. It can be heavy, light, dark,

thin, smooth, murky, or clear. Some other words that musicians use to describe the

timbre of a sound are: reedy, brassy, piercing, mellow, hollow, focussed, transparent,

the violin a noticeably "brighter" sound that is not simply a matter of the violin playing

higher notes. Now listen to the same phrase played by an electric guitar, an acoustic

Where do the harmonics, and the timbre, come from? When a string vibrates, the

main pitch you hear is from the vibration of the whole string back and forth. That is

the fundamental, or first harmonic. But the string also vibrates in halves, in thirds,

fourths, and so on. (Please see Standing Waves and Musical Instruments for more on

the physics of how harmonics are produced.) Each of these fractions also produces a

harmonic. The string vibrating in halves produces the second harmonic; vibrating in

thirds produces the third harmonic, and so on.

Note: This method of naming and numbering harmonics is the most

straightforward and least confusing, but there are other ways of naming and

numbering harmonics, and this can cause confusion. Some musicians do not

consider the fundamental to be a harmonic; it is just the fundamental. In that

case, the string halves will give the first harmonic, the string thirds will give

case, the string halves will give the first harmonic, the string thirds will give

the second harmonic and so on. When the fundamental is included in calculations, it is called the first partial, and the rest of the harmonics are the

second, third, fourth partials and so on. Also, some musicians use the term

overtones as a synonym for harmonics. For others, however, an overtone is

any frequency (not necessarily a harmonic) that can be heard resonating with

the fundamental. The sound of a gong or cymbals will include overtones that

aren't harmonics; that's why the gong's sound doesn't seem to have as

definite a pitch as the vibrating string does. If you are uncertain what someone

means when they refer to "the second harmonic" or "overtones", ask for

clarification.

Figure 3.12 Vibrating String The fundamental pitch is produced by the whole string vibrating back and

forth. But the string is also vibrating in halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, and so on, producing harmonics. All of

these vibrations happen at the same time, producing a rich, complex, interesting sound.

A column of air vibrating inside a tube is different from a vibrating string, but the

column of air can also vibrate in halves, thirds, fourths, and so on, of the fundamental,

so the harmonic series will be the same. So why do different instruments have

different timbres? The difference is the relative loudness of all the different harmonics

compared to each other. When a clarinet plays a note, perhaps the odd-numbered

harmonics are strongest; when a French horn plays the same note, perhaps the fifth

and tenth harmonics are the strongest. This is what you hear that allows you to

recognize that it is a clarinet or horn that is playing. The relative strength of the

A harmonic series can have any note as its fundamental, so there are many different

harmonic series. But the relationship between the frequencies of a harmonic series is

always the same. The second harmonic always has exactly half the wavelength (and

twice the frequency) of the fundamental; the third harmonic always has exactly a third

of the wavelength (and so three times the frequency) of the fundamental, and so on.

Figure 3.13 Harmonic Series Wavelengths and Frequencies The second harmonic has half the

wavelength and twice the frequency of the first. The third harmonic has a third the wavelength and three

times the frequency of the first. The fourth harmonic has a quarter the wavelength and four times the

frequency of the first, and so on. Notice that the fourth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the second

harmonic, and the sixth harmonic is also twice the frequency of the third harmonic.

Say someone plays a note, a middle C. Now someone else plays the note that is twice

the frequency of the middle C. Since this second note was already a harmonic of the

first note, the sound waves of the two notes reinforce each other and sound good

together. If the second person played instead the note that was just a litle bit more

than twice the frequency of the first note, the harmonic series of the two notes would

not fit together at all, and the two notes would not sound as good together. There are

many combinations of notes that share some harmonics and make a pleasant sound

together. They are considered consonant. Other combinations share fewer or no

harmonics and are considered dissonant or, when they really clash, simply "out of

tune" with each other. The scales and harmonies of most of the world's musics are

based on these physical facts.

Note: In real music, consonance and dissonance also depend on the standard

practices of a musical tradition, especially its harmony and tuning practices,

but these are also often related to the harmonic series.

For example, a note that is twice the frequency of another note is one octave higher

than the first note. So in the figure above, the second harmonic is one octave higher

than the first; the fourth harmonic is one octave higher than the second; and the sixth

harmonic is one octave higher than the third.

1. Which harmonic will be one octave higher than the fourth harmonic?

2. Predict the next four sets of octaves in a harmonic series.

3. What is the pattern that predicts which notes of a harmonic series will be one

octave apart?

4. Notes one octave apart are given the same name. So if the first harmonic is a "A",

the second and fourth will also be A's. Name three other harmonics that will also

be A's.

A mathematical way to say this is "if two notes are an octave apart, the ratio of their

frequencies is two to one (2:1)". Although the notes themselves can be any frequency,

the 2:1 ratio is the same for all octaves. Other frequency ratios between two notes

also lead to particular pitch relationships between the notes, so we will return to the harmonic series later, after learning to name those pitch relationships, or intervals.

Musical notes, like all sounds, are made of sound waves. The sound waves that make

musical notes are very evenly-spaced waves, and the qualities of these regular waves -

for example how big they are or how far apart they are - affect the sound of the note.

A note can be high or low, depending on how often (how frequently) one of its waves

arrives at your ear. When scientists and engineers talk about how high or low a sound

is, they talk about its frequency. The higher the frequency of a note, the higher it

sounds. They can measure the frequency of notes, and like most measurements, these will be numbers, like "440 vibrations per second."

But people have been making music and talking about music since long before we

knew that sounds were waves with frequencies. So when musicians talk about how

high or low a note sounds, they usually don't talk about frequency; they talk about the

note's pitch. And instead of numbers, they give the notes names, like "C". (For

example, musicians call the note with frequency "440 vibrations per second" an "A".)

But to see where octaves come from, let's talk about frequencies a little more. Imagine

a few men are singing a song together. Nobody is singing harmony; they are all

singing the same pitch - the same frequency - for each note.

Now some women join in the song. They can't sing where the men are singing; that's

too low for their voices. Instead they sing notes that are exactly double the frequency

that the men are singing.

That means their note has exactly two waves for each one wave that the men's note

has. These two frequencies fit so well together that it sounds like the women are

singing the same notes as the men, in the same key. They are just singing them one

octave higher. Any note that is twice the frequency of another note is one octave higher.

Notes that are one octave apart are so closely related to each other that musicians

give them the same name. A note that is an octave higher or lower than a note named

"C natural" will also be named "C natural". A note that is one (or more) octaves higher

"C natural" will also be named "C natural". A note that is one (or more) octaves higher

or lower than an "F sharp" will also be an "F sharp". (For more discussion of how notes

are related because of their frequencies, see The Harmonic Series3, Standing Waves

and Musical Instruments, and Standing Waves and Wind Instruments4.)

Figure 4.2 Octave Frequencies When two notes are one octave apart, one has a frequency exactly two

times higher than the other - it has twice as many waves. These waves fit together so well, in the instrument,

and in the air, and in your ears, that they sound almost like different versions of the same note.

The notes in different octaves are so closely related that when musicians talk about a

note, a "G" for example, it often doesn't matter which G they are talking about. We can

talk about the "F sharp" in a G major scale without mentioning which octave the scale

or the F sharp are in, because the scale is the same in every octave. Because of this,

many discussions of music theory don't bother naming octaves. Informally, musicians

often speak of "the B on the staff" or the "A above the staff", if it's clear which staff

they're talking about.

But there are also two formal systems for naming the notes in a particular octave.

Figure 4.3 Naming Octaves The octaves are named from one C to the next higher C. For example, all the

notes in between "one line c" and "two line c" are "one line" notes.

The octave below contra can be labelled CCC or Co; higher octaves can be labelled

with higher numbers or more lines. Octaves are named from one C to the next higher

C. For example, all the notes between "great C" and "small C" are "great". One-line c is

also often called "middle C". No other notes are called "middle", only the C.

The word "octave" comes from a Latin root meaning "eight". It seems an odd name for

a frequency that is two times, not eight times, higher. The octave was named by

musicians who were more interested in how octaves are divided into scales, than in

how their frequencies are related. Octaves aren't the only notes that sound good

together. The people in different musical traditions have different ideas about what

notes they think sound best together. In the Western musical tradition - which

includes most familiar music from Europe and the Americas - the octave is divided up

into twelve equally spaced notes. If you play all twelve of these notes within one

octave you are playing a chromatic scale (pg 123). Other musical traditions - traditional

Chinese music for example - have divided the octave differently and so they use

different scales. (Please see Major Keys and Scales, Minor Keys and Scales, and Scales

that aren't Major or Minor for more about this.)

You may be thinking "OK, that's twelve notes; that still has nothing to do with the

number eight", but out of those twelve notes, only seven are used in any particular

majoror minor scale. Add the first note of the next octave, so that you have that a

"complete"- sounding scale ("do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti" and then "do" again), and you have the eight notes of the octave. These are the diatonic scales, and they are the basis of

most Western music.

Now take a look at the piano keyboard. Only seven letter names are used to name

notes: A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. The eighth note would, of course, be the next A, beginning

the next octave. To name the other notes, the notes on the black piano keys, you have

to use a sharp or flat sign.

Figure 4.6 Keyboard The white keys are the natural notes. Black keys can only be named using sharps or

flats. The pattern repeats at the eighth tone of a scale, the octave.

Whether it is a popular song, a classical symphony, or an old folk tune, most of the

music that feels comfortable and familiar (to Western listeners) is based on either a major or minor scale. It is tonal music that mostly uses only seven of the notes within

an octave: only one of the possible A's (A sharp, A natural, or A flat), one of the

possible B's (B sharp, B natural, or B flat), and so on. The other notes in the chromatic

scale are (usually) used sparingly to add interest or to (temporarily) change the key in

the middle of the music. For more on the keys and scales that are the basis of tonal

music, see Major Keys and Scales and Minor Keys and Scales .

The pitch of a note is how high or low it sounds. Musicians often find it useful to talk

about how much higher or lower one note is than another. This distance between two

pitches is called the interval between them. In Western music, the small interval from

one note to the next closest note higher or lower is called a half step or semi-tone.

So a scale that goes up or down by half steps, a chromatic scale, plays all the notes

on both the white and black keys of a piano. It also plays all the notes easily available

on most Western instruments. (A few instruments, like trombone7 and violin, can

easily play pitches that aren't in the chromatic scale, but even they usually don't.)

The simple, sing-along, nursery rhymes and folk songs we learn as children, the

cheerful, toe-tapping pop and rock we dance to, the uplifting sounds of a symphony:

most music in a major key has a bright sound that people often describe as cheerful,

inspiring, exciting, or just plain fun.

Music in a particular key tends to use only some of the many possible notes available;

these notes are listed in the scale associated with that key. The notes that a major key

uses tend to build "bright"-sounding major chords. They also give a strong feeling of

having a Tonal Center (Page 116), a note or chord that feels like "home" in that key.

The "bright"-sounding major chords and the strong feeling of tonality are what give

major keys their pleasant moods.

A scale starts with the note that names the key. This note is the tonal center of that

key, the note where music in that key feels "at rest". It is also called the tonic, and it's

the "do" in "do-re-mi". For example, music in the key of A major almost always ends on

an A major chord, the chord (Chords) built on the note A. It often also begins on that

chord, returns to that chord often, and features a melody and a bass line that also

return to the note A often enough that listeners will know where the tonal center of

the music is, even if they don't realize that they know it. (For more information about

the tonic chord and its relationship to other chords in a key, please see Cadence (Page

177).)

on that note. If you're not sure whether a note should be written as a flat, sharp, or

natural, remember that you won't ever skip a line or space, or write two notes of the

scale on the same line or space. If you need help keeping track of half steps, use a

keyboard, a picture of a Figure 4.6, a written chromatic scale, or the chromatic scale

Listen to this tune in D major and in F major. The music may look quite different, but

the only difference when you listen is that one sounds higher than the other. So why

bother with different keys at all? Before equal temperament became the standard

tuning system, major keys sounded more different from each other than they do now.

Each major key uses a different set of notes (its major scale). In each major scale,

however, the notes are arranged in the same major scale pattern and build the same

music that is in D minor will have a different quality, because the notes in the minor

scale follow a different pattern and so have different relationships with each other.

Music in minor keys has a different sound and emotional feel, and develops differently

harmonically. So you can't, for example, transpose a piece from C major to D minor

(or even to C minor) without changing it a great deal. Music that is in a minor key is

sometimes described as sounding more solemn, sad, mysterious, or ominous than

music that is in a major key. To hear some simple examples in both major and minor

keys, see Major Keys and Scales.

Minor scales sound different from major scales because they are based on a different

pattern of intervals . Just as it did in major scales, starting the minor scale pattern on a

different note will give you a different key signature, a different set of sharps or flats.

The scale that is created by playing all the notes in a minor key signature is a natural

minor scale. To create a natural minor scale, start on the tonic note and go up the

scale using the interval pattern: whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, half step,

whole step, whole step.

Each minor key shares a key signature with a major key. A minor key is called the

relative minor of the major key that has the same key signature. Even though they

have the same key signature, a minor key and its relative major sound very different.

They have different tonal centers, and each will feature melodies, harmonies, and

chord progressions (Chords) built around their (different) tonal centers. In fact, certain

strategic accidentalsare very useful in helping establish a strong tonal center in a

minor key. These useful accidentals are featured in the melodic minorand harmonic

minor scales.

minor scales are basically the same pattern starting at different points.

It is easy to predict where the relative minor of a major key can be found. Notice that

the pattern for minor scales overlaps the pattern for major scales. In other words,

they are the same pattern starting in a different place. (If the patterns were very

different, minor key signatures would not be the same as major key signatures.) The

pattern for the minor scale starts a half step plus a whole step lower than the major

scale pattern, so a relative minor is always three half steps lower than its relative

major. For example, C minor has the same key signature as E flat major, since E flat is

a minor third higher than C.

All of the scales above are natural minor scales. They contain only the notes in the

minor key signature. There are two other kinds of minor scales that are commonly

used, both of which include notes that are not in the key signature. The harmonic

minor scale raises the seventh note of the scale by one half step, whether you are

going up or down the scale. Harmonies in minor keys often use this raised seventh

tone in order to make the music feel more strongly centered on the tonic (Please see

Beginning Harmonic Analysis for more about this.) In the melodicminor scale, the

sixth and seventh notes of the scale are each raised by one half step when going up

the scale, but return to the natural minor when going down the scale. Melodies in

minor keys often use this particular pattern of accidentals, so instrumentalists find it

useful to practice melodic minor scales.

Major and minor scales are traditionally the basis for Western Music , but jazz theory

also recognizes other scales, based on the medieval church modes, which are very

useful for improvisation. One of the most useful of these is the scale based on the

dorian mode, which is often called the dorian minor, since it has a basically minor

sound. Like any minor scale, dorian minor may start on any note, but like dorian

mode, it is often illustrated as natural notes beginning on d.

Figure 4.22 Dorian Minor The "dorian minor" can be written as a scale of natural notes starting on d.

Any scale with this interval pattern can be called a "dorian minor scale".

Comparing this scale to the natural minor scale makes it easy to see why the dorian

You may find it helpful to notice that the "relative major" of the Dorian begins one

whole step lower. (So, for example, D Dorian has the same key signature as C major.)

In fact, the reason that Dorian is so useful in jazz is that it is the scale used for

improvising while a ii chord is being played (for example, while a d minor chord is

played in the key of C major), a chord which is very common in jazz. (See Beginning

Harmonic Analysis (Page 171) for more about how chords are classified within a key.)

The student who is interested in modal jazz will eventually become acquainted with all of the modal scales. Each of these is named for the medieval church mode which has

the same interval pattern, and each can be used with a different chord within the key.

Dorian is included here only to explain the common jazz reference to the "dorian

minor" and to give notice to students that the jazz approach to scales can be quite

different from the traditional classical approach.

The interval between two notes is the distance between the two pitches - in other

words, how much higher or lower one note is than the other. This concept is so

important that it is almost impossible to talk about scales, chords (Chords), harmonic

progression (Chords), cadence, or dissonance without referring to intervals. So if you

want to learn music theory, it would be a good idea to spend some time getting

comfortable with the concepts below and practicing identifying intervals.

Scientists usually describe the distance between two pitches in terms of the difference

between their frequencies. Musicians find it more useful to talk about interval.

Intervals can be described using half steps and whole steps. For example, you can say

"B natural is a half-step below C natural", or "E flat is a step and a half above C

natural". But when we talk about larger intervals in the major/minor system, there is a

more convenient and descriptive way to name them.

The first step in naming the interval is to find the distance between the notes as they

are written on the staff. Count every line and every space in between the notes, as

well as the lines or spaces that the notes are on. This gives you the number for the

interval.

To find the interval, count the lines or spaces that the two notes are on as well as all

the lines or spaces in between. The interval between B and D is a third. The interval

between A and F is a sixth. Note that, at this stage, key signature, clef, and accidentals

do not matter at all.

The simple intervals are one octave or smaller.

So far, the actual distance, in half-steps, between the two notes has not mattered. But

a third made up of three half-steps sounds different from a third made up of four half-

steps. And a fifth made up of seven half-steps sounds very different from one of only

six half-steps. So in the second step of identifying an interval, clef , key signature, and

accidentals become important.

Figure 4.30 Intervals A to C natural and A to C sharp are both thirds, but A to C sharp is a larger interval,

with a different sound. The difference between the intervals A to E natural and A to E flat is even more

noticeable.

Listen to the differences in the thirds and the fifths in the above Figure 4.30.

So the second step to naming an interval is to classify it based on the number of Half

Steps and Whole Steps (Page 111) in the interval. Familiarity with the chromatic scale

is necessary to do this accurately.

Primes, octaves, fourths, and fifths can be perfect intervals.

Note: These intervals are never classified as major or minor, although they can

be augmented or diminished (see below).

What makes these particular intervals perfect? The physics of sound waves (acoustics)

shows us that the notes of a perfect interval are very closely related to each other. (For

more information on this, see Frequency, Wavelength, and Pitch and Harmonic

Series.) Because they are so closely related, they sound particularly good together, a

fact that has been noticed since at least the times of classical Greece, and probably

even longer. (Both the octave and the perfect fifth have prominent positions in most

of the world's musical traditions.) Because they sound so closely related to each other,

they have been given the name "perfect" intervals.

Note: Actually, modern equal Equal Temperament (Page 204) tuning does not give the

Pythagorean Intonation (Page 200) perfect fourths and fifths. For the musictheory

purpose of identifying intervals, this does not matter. To learn more about how tuning

affects intervals as they are actually played, see Tuning Systems (Page 197).

A perfect prime is also called a unison. It is two notes that are the same pitch. A

perfect octave is the "same" note an octave - 12 half-steps - higher or lower. A perfect

5th is 7 half-steps. A perfect fourth is 5 half-steps.

If an interval is a half-step larger than a perfect or a major interval, it is called

augmented. An interval that is a half-step smaller than a perfect or a minor interval is

called diminished. A double sharp or double flat is sometimes needed to write an

augmented or diminished interval correctly. Always remember, though, that it is the

actual distance in half steps between the notes that determines the type of interval,

not whether the notes are written as natural, sharp, or double-sharp.

As mentioned above, the diminished fifth and augmented fourth sound the same.

Both are six half-steps, or three whole tones, so another term for this interval is a

tritone. In Western Music, this unique interval, which cannot be spelled as a major,

minor, or perfect interval, is considered unusually Consonance and Dissonance (Page

162) and unstable (tending to want to resolve to another interval).

You have probably noticed by now that the tritone is not the only interval that can be

"spelled" in more than one way. In fact, because of enharmonic spellings, the interval

for any two pitches can be written in various ways. A major third could be written as a

diminished fourth, for example, or a minor second as an augmented prime. Always

classify the interval as it is written; the composer had a reason for writing it that way.

That reason sometimes has to do with subtle differences in the way different written

notes will be interpreted by performers, but it is mostly a matter of placing the notes

correctly in the context of the key, the chord, and the evolving harmony. (Please see

Cadence (Page 177) for more on that subject.)

To invert any interval, simply imagine that one of the notes has moved one octave, so

that the higher note has become the lower and vice-versa. Because inverting an

interval only involves moving one note by an octave (it is still essentially the "same"

note in the tonal system), intervals that are inversions of each other have a very close

relationship in the tonal system.

To find the inversion of an interval

1. To name the new interval, subtract the name of the old interval from 9.

2. The inversion of a perfect interval is still perfect.

3. The inversion of a major interval is minor, and of a minor interval is major.

4. The inversion of an augmented interval is diminished and of a diminished interval

The names of the various intervals, and the way they are written on the staff, are

mostly the result of a long history of evolving musical notation and theory. But the

actual intervals - the way the notes sound - are not arbitrary accidents of history. Like

octaves, the other intervals are also produced by the harmonic series. Recall that the

frequencies of any two pitches that are one octave apart have a 2:1 ratio. (See

Harmonic Series I to review this.) Every other interval that musicians talk about can

also be described as having a particular frequency ratio.

To find those ratios, look at a harmonic series written in common notation.

Look at the third harmonic in Figure 4.40. Its frequency is three times the frequency of

the first harmonic (ratio 3:1). Remember, the frequency of the second harmonic is two

times that of the first harmonic (ratio 2:1). In other words, there are two waves of the

higher C for every one wave of the lower C, and three waves of the third-harmonic G

for every one wave of the fundamental. So the ratio69 of the frequencies of the

second to the third harmonics is 2:3. (In other words, two waves of the C for every

three of the G.) From the harmonic series shown above, you can see that the interval (Section 4.5) between these two notes is a perfect fifth . The ratio of the frequencies of

all perfect fifths is 2:3.

between 9 and 10, and between 10 and 11. But 7:8, 8:9, 9:10, and 10:11, although

they are pretty close, are not exactly the same. In fact, modern Western music

uses the equal temperament tuning system, which divides the octave into

twelve notes that are equally far apart. (They do have the same frequency

ratios, unlike the half steps in the harmonic series.) The positive aspect of

equal temperament (and the reason it is used) is that an instrument will be

equally in tune in all keys. The negative aspect is that it means that all

intervals except for octaves are slightly out of tune with regard to the actual

harmonic series. For more about equal temperament, see Tuning Systems.

Interestingly, musicians have a tendency to revert to true harmonics when

they can (in other words, when it is easy to fine-tune each note). For example,

an a capella choral group, or a brass ensemble, may find themselves singing or

The harmonic series is particularly important for brass instruments. A pianist or

xylophone player only gets one note from each key. A string player who wants a

different note from a string holds the string tightly in a different place. This basically

makes a vibrating string of a new length, with a new fundamental.

But a brass player, without changing the length of the instrument, gets different notes

by actually playing the harmonics of the instrument. Woodwinds also do this, although

not as much. Most woodwinds can get two different octaves with essentially the same

fingering; the lower octave is the fundamental of the column of air inside the

instrument at that fingering. The upper octave is the first harmonic.

Note: In some woodwinds, such as the clarinet, the upper "octave" may

The sound of a brass instruments starts with vibrations of the player's lips. By

vibrating the lips at different speeds, the player can cause a harmonic of the air

column to sound instead of the fundamental. Thus a bugle player can play any note in

the harmonic series of the instrument that falls within the player's range. Compare

these well-known bugle calls to the harmonic series above.

Figure 4.41 Bugle Calls Although limited by the fact that it can only play one harmonic series, the bugle can

still play many well-known tunes.

For centuries, all brass instruments were valveless. A brass instrument could play only

the notes of one harmonic series. (An important exception was the trombone and its

relatives, which can easily change their length and harmonic series using a slide.) The

upper octaves of the series, where the notes are close enough together to play an

interesting melody, were often difficult to play, and some of the harmonics sound

quite out of tune to ears that expect equal temperament. The solution to these

problems, once brass valves were perfected, was to add a few valves to the

instrument; three is usually enough. Each valve opens an extra length of tube, making

the instrument a little longer, and making available a whole new harmonic series.

Usually one valve gives the harmonic series one half step lower than the valveless

The valves can be used in combination, too, making even more harmonic series

available. So a valved brass instrument can find, in the comfortable middle of its range

(its middle register), a valve combination that will give a reasonably in-tune version

for every note of the chromatic scale. (For more on the history of valved brass, see

History of the French Horn. For more on how and why harmonics are produced in

wind instruments, please see Standing Waves and Wind Instruments)

Note: Trombones still use a slide instead of valves to make their instrument

longer. But the basic principle is still the same. At each slide "position", the

instrument gets a new harmonic series. The notes in between the positions

aren't part of the chromatic scale, so they are usually only used for special

effects like glissandos (sliding notes).

Figure 4.42 Overlapping Harmonic Series in Brass Instruments These harmonic series are for a brass

instrument that has a "C" fundamental when no valves are being used - for example, a C trumpet.

Remember, there is an entire harmonic series for every fundamental, and any note can be a fundamental.

You just have to find the brass tube with the right length. So a trumpet or tuba can get one harmonic series

using no valves, another one a half step lower using one valve, another one a whole step lower using

another valve, and so on. By the time all the combinations of valves are used, there is some way to get an

in-tune version of every note they need.

valves are open. (You can use this PDF file if you need staff paper.) What new notes

are added in the instrument's middle range? Are any notes still missing?

Note: The French horn has a reputation for being a "difficult" instrument to play. This

is also because of the harmonic series. Most brass instruments play in the first few

octaves of the harmonic series, where the notes are farther apart and it takes a pretty

big difference in the mouth and lips (the embouchure, pronounced AHM-buh-sher) to

get a different note. The range of the French horn is higher in the harmonic series,

where the notes are closer together. So very small differences in the mouth and lips

can mean the wrong harmonic comes out.

String players also use harmonics, although not as much as brass players. Harmonics

on strings have a very different timbre from ordinary string sounds. They give a

quieter, thinner, more bell-like tone, and are usually used as a kind of ear-catching

special-effect.

Normally a string player holds a string down very tightly. This shortens the length of

the vibrating part of the string, in effect making a (temporarily) shorter vibrating string,

which has its own full set of harmonics.

To "play a harmonic", the string is touched very, very lightly instead. The length of the

string does not change. Instead, the light touch interferes with all of the vibrations that

don't have a node (Figure 3.7) at that spot.

The thinner, quieter sound of "playing harmonics" is caused by the fact that much of

the harmonic series is missing from the sound, which will of course affect the timbre.

Lightly touching the string in most places will result in no sound at all. This technique

only works well at places on the string where a main harmonic (one of the longer,

louder lower-numbered harmonics) has a node. Some string players can get more

harmonics by both holding the string down in one spot and touching it lightly in

another spot, but this is an advanced technique.

Figure 4.44 Circle of Fifths The major key for each key signature is shown as a capital letter; the minor key

as a small letter. In theory, one could continue around the circle adding flats or sharps (so that B major is

also C flat major, with seven flats, E major is also F flat major, with 6 flats and a double flat, and so on), but

in practice such key signatures are very rare.

Keys are not considered closely related to each other if they are near each other in the

chromatic scale (or on a keyboard). What makes two keys "closely related" is having

similar key signatures. So the most closely related key to C major, for example, is A

minor, since they have the same key signature (no sharps and no flats). This puts them

in the same "slice" of the circle. The next most closely related keys to C major would

be G major (or E minor), with one sharp, and F major (or D minor), with only one flat.

The circle of fifths gets its name from the fact that as you go from one section of the

circle to the next, you are going up or down by an interval of a perfect fifth.

If you go up a perfect fifth (clockwise in the circle), you get the key that has one more

sharp or one less flat; if you go down a perfect fifth (counterclockwise), you get the key

The key of D major has two sharps. Using the circle of fifths, we find that the most

closely related major keys (one in each direction) are G major, with only one sharp,

and A major, with three sharps. The relative minors of all of these keys (B minor, E

minor, and F sharp minor) are also closely related to D major.

If you do not know the order of the sharps and flats, you can also use the circle of

fifths to find these. The first sharp in a key signature is always F sharp; the second

sharp in a key signature is always (a perfect fifth away) C sharp; the third is always G

sharp, and so on, all the way to B sharp. The first flat in a key signature is always B flat

(the same as the last sharp); the second is always E flat, and so on, all the way to F flat.

Notice that, just as with the key signatures, you add sharps or subtract flats as you go

clockwise around the circle, and add flats or subtract sharps as you go Counter-

clockwise.

One of the things that makes music pleasant to hear and easy to "understand" is that

only a few of all the possible pitches are used. But not all pieces of music use the same

set of pitches. In order to be familiar with the particular notes that a piece of music is

likely to use, musicians study scales.

The set of expected pitches for a piece of music can be arranged into a scale. In a

scale, the pitches are usually arranged from lowest to highest (or highest to lowest), in

a pattern that usually repeats within every octave .

Note: In some kinds of music, the notes of a particular scale are the only notes

allowed in a given piece of music. In other music traditions, notes from outside

the scale (accidentals) are allowed, but are usually much less common than the

scale notes.

The set of pitches, or notes, that are used, and their relationships to each other,

makes a big impact on how the music sounds. For example, for centuries, most

Western music has been based on major and minor scales. That is one of the things

that makes it instantly recognizable as Western music. Much (though not all) of the music of eastern Asia, on the other hand, was for many centuries based on pentatonic

scales, giving it a much different flavor that is also easy to recognize.

Some of the more commonly used scales that are not major or minor are introduced

here. Pentatonic scales are often associated with eastern Asia, but many other music

traditions also use them. Blues scales, used in blues, jazz, and other African-American

traditions, grew out of a compromise between European and African scales. Some of

the scales that sound "exotic" to the Western ear are taken from the musical traditions

of eastern Europe, the Middle East, and western Asia. Microtones can be found in

The Western musical tradition that developed in Europe after the middle ages is based

on major and minor scales, but there are other scales that are a part of this tradition.

In the chromatic scale, every interval is a half-step. This scale gives all the sharp, flat,

and natural notes commonly used in all Western music. It is also the twelve-tone

scale used by twentieth-century composers to create their atonal music. Young

instrumentalists are encouraged to practice playing the chromatic scale in order to

ensure that they know the fingerings for all the notes. Listen to a chromatic scale.

Figure 4.47 Chromatic Scale The chromatic scale includes all the pitches normally found in Western music.

Note that, because of enharmonic spelling, many of these pitches could be written in a different way (for

example, using flats instead of sharps).

In a whole tone scale, every interval is a whole step. In both the chromatic and the

whole tone scales, all the intervals are the same. This results in scales that have no

tonal center; no note feels more or less important than the others. Because of this,

most traditional and popular Western music uses major or minor scales rather than

the chromatic or whole tone scales. But composers who don't want their music to

have a tonal center (for example, many composers of "modern classical" music) often

use these scales. Listen to a whole tone scale.

In a pentatonic scale, only five of the possible pitches within an octave are used. (So

the scale will repeat starting at the sixth tone.) The most familiar pentatonic scales are

used in much of the music of eastern Asia. You may be familiar with the scale in the

Listen to the black key pentatonic scale. Like other scales, this pentatonic scale is

transposable (Section 6.4); you can move the entire scale up or down by a half step or

a major third or any interval you like. The scale will sound higher or lower, but other

than that it will sound the same, because the pattern of intervals between the notes

(half steps, whole steps, and minor thirds) is the same. (For more on intervals, see Half

Steps and Whole Steps and Interval. For more on patterns of intervals within scales,

see Major Scales and Minor Scales.) Now listen to a transposed pentatonic scale.

Figure 4.50 Transposed Pentatonic Scale This is simply a transposition of the scale in Figure 4.49

But this is not the only possible type of pentatonic scale. Any scale that uses only five

notes within one octave is a pentatonic scale. The following pentatonic scale, for

example, is not simply another transposition of the "black key" pentatonic scale; the

Figure 4.51 Different Pentatonic Scale This pentatonic scale is not a transposed version of Figure 4.49.It

has a different set of intervals.

The point here is that music based on the pentatonic scale in this Figure 4.49 will

sound very different from music based on the pentatonic scale in the Figure 4.51,

because the relationships between the notes are different, much as music in a minor

key is noticeably different from music in a major key. So there are quite a few different

possible pentatonic scales that will produce a recognizably "unique sound", and many

of these possible five-note scales have been named and used in various music

traditions around the world.

To get a feeling for the concepts in this section, try composing some short pieces using

the pentatonic scales given in Figure 4.49 and in Figure 4.51. You may use more than

one octave of each scale, but use only one scale for each piece. As you are composing,

listen for how the constraints of using only those five notes, with those pitch

relationships, affect your music. See if you can play your Figure 4.49 composition in a

different key, for example, using the scale in Figure 4.50 .

Any scale will list a certain number of notes within an octave. For major and minor

scales, there are seven notes; for pentatonic, five; for a chromatic scale, twelve.

Although some divisions are more common than others, any division can be imagined,

and many are used in different musical traditions around the world. For example, the

classical music of India recognizes twenty-two different possible pitches within an octave; each raga uses five, six, or seven of these possible pitches. (Please see Indian

Classical Music: Tuning and Ragas for more on this.) And there are some traditions in

Africa that use six or eight notes within an octave. Listen to one possible eight-tone, or

octatonic scale.

for example, or other intervals we don't use. Even trying to write them in common

notation can be a bit misleading.

Microtones are intervals smaller than a half step. Besides being necessary to describe

the scales and tuning systems of many Non-Western traditions, they have also been

used in modern Western classical music, and are also used in African-American

traditions such as jazz and blues. As of this writing, the Huygens-Fokker Foundation

was a good place to start looking for information on microtonal music.

Blues scales are closely related to pentatonic scales. (Some versions are pentatonic.)

Rearrange the pentatonic scale in Figure 4.50 above so that it begins on the C, and add

an F sharp in between the F and G, and you have a commonly used version of the

blues scale. Listen to this blues scale.

Many music traditions do not use scales. The most familiar of these to the Western

listener are medieval chant and the classical music of India. In these and other modal

traditions, the rules for constructing a piece of music are quite different than the rules

for music that is based on a scale. Please see Modes and Ragas for more information.

There are many other possible scales that are not part of the major-minor system;

these are sometimes called "exotic" scales, since they are outside the usual Western

system. Some, like pentatonic and octatonic scales, have fewer or more notes per

octave, but many have seven tones, just as a major scale does. Some, like the whole

tone scale, are invented by composers exploring new ideas. Others, which may be

given appellations such as "Persian" or "Hungarian" by the person using or studying

them, are loosely based on the music of other cultures. These scales are sometimes

borrowed from music that is actually modal, but then they are used in Western

classical, jazz or "world" music simply as unusual scales. Since they usually ignore the

tuning, melodic forms, and other aesthetic principles of the traditions that they are

borrowed from, these "exotic" scales should not be considered accurate

representations of those traditions.

If you want to compose or improvise music, you can experiment with making up new

scales, unusual combinations of notes to be used in your music. Or you can look up

some of the many "exotic" scales already in use. (Try a web search for "exotic scales".)

Here are just a few examples of the many possibilities. Listen to the "symmetrical"

scale, "enigmatic" scale, "Arabian" Scale, and "Hungarian Major" Scale.

flat major (numbers 5 and 6) sound exactly the same when played, on a piano as

shown in the following Figure 4.59, or on any other instrument using equal

temperament tuning. If this surprises you, please read more about enharmonic scales.

1. The ratio 4:6 reduced to lowest terms is 2:3. (In other words, they are two ways of

writing the same mathematical relationship. If you are more comfortable with

fractions than with ratios, think of all the ratios as fractions instead. 2:3 is just

two-thirds, and 4:6 is four-sixths. Four-sixths reduces to two-thirds.)

2. Six and nine (6:9 also reduces to 2:3); eight and twelve; ten and fifteen; and any

The chords in Figure 5.1 are written in root position, which is the most basic way to

write a triad. In root position, the root, which is the note that names the chord, is the

lowest note. The thirdof the chord is written a third (Figure 4.26) higher than the

root, and the fifth of the chord is written a fifth (Figure 4.26) higher than the root

(which is also a third higher than the third of the chord). So the simplest way to write a

triad is as a stack of thirds, in root position.

Note: The type of interval or chord - major, minor, diminished, etc., is not

important when you are determining the position of the chord. To simplify

things, all notes in the examples and exercises below are natural, but it would

not change their position at all if some notes were sharp or flat. It would,

however, change the name of the triad â see Naming Triads.

Any other chord that has the same-named notes as a root position chord is

considered to be essentially the same chord in a different position. In other words, all

chords that have only D naturals, F sharps, and A naturals, are considered D major

chords.

Note: But if you change the pitch or spelling of any note in the triad, you have

changed the chord (see Naming Triads). For example, if the F sharps are

written as G flats, or if the A's are sharp instead of natural, you have a different

chord, not an inversion of the same chord. If you add notes, you have also

changed the name of the chord (see Beyond Triads). You cannot call one chord

the inversion of another if either one of them has a note that does not share a

name (for example "F sharp" or "B natural") with a note in the other chord.

If the third of the chord is the lowest note, the chord is in first inversion. If the fifth of

the chord is the lowest note, the chord is in secondinversion. A chord in second

inversion may also be called a six-four chord, because the intervals (Section 4.5) in it

are a sixth and a fourth.

It does not matter how far the higher notes are from the lowest note, or how many of

each note there are (at different octaves or on different instruments); all that matters

is which note is lowest. (In fact, one of the notes may not even be written, only implied

by the context of the chord in a piece of music. A practiced ear will tell you what the missing note is; we won't worry about that here.) To decide what position a chord is in,

move the notes to make a stack of thirds and identify the root.

A much bigger difference in the chord's sound comes from the Frequency and Interval

(Page 132) between the root-position notes of the chord. For example, if the B in one

of the chords above was changed to a B flat, you would still have a G triad, but the

chord would now sound very different. So chords are named according to the

intervals between the notes when the chord is in root position. Listen to four different

G chords.

The most commonly used triads form major chords and minor chords. All major

chords and minor chords have an interval of a perfect fifth between the root and the

fifth of the chord. A perfect fifth (7 half-steps) can be divided into a major third (Major

third (with the minor third between the third and the fifth of the chord), the triad is a

major chord. If the interval between the root and the third of the chord is the minor

third (and the major third is between the third and fifth of the chord), then the triad is

a minor chord. Listen closely to a major triad and a minor triad.

Because they don't contain a perfect fifth, augmented and diminished chords have an

unsettled feeling and are normally used sparingly. An augmented chord is built from

two major thirds, which adds up to an augmented fifth. A diminished chord is built

from two minor thirds, which add up to a diminished fifth. Listen closely to an

augmented triad and a diminished triad.

Notice that you can't avoid double sharps or double flats by writing the note on a

different space o r line. If you change the spelling of a chord's notes, you have also

changed the chord's name. For example, if, in an augmented G sharp major chord,

you rewrite the D double sharp as an E natural, the triad becomes an E augmented

chord.

Figure 5.16 Changing the spelling of any note in a chord also changes the chord's name.

You can put the chord in a different position or add more of the same-named notes at

other octaves without changing the name of the chord. But changing the note names

or adding different-named notes, will change the name of the chord. Here is a

summary of the intervals in triads in root position.

Notes that are dissonant can sound harsh or unpleasant when played at the same

time. Or they may simply feel "unstable"; if you hear a chord with a dissonance in it,

you may feel that the music is pulling you towards the chord that resolves the

dissonance. Obviously, what seems pleasant or unpleasant is partly a matter of

opinion. This discussion only covers consonance and dissonance in Western music.

Of course, if there are problems with tuning, the notes will not sound good together,

but this is not what consonance and dissonance are about. (Please note, though, that

the choice of tuning system can greatly affect which intervals sound consonant and

which sound dissonant! Please see Tuning Systems for more about this.)

Consonance and dissonance refer to intervals and chords (Chords). The interval

between two notes is the number of half steps between them, and all intervals have a

name that musicians commonly use, like major third (Major and Minor Intervals)

(which is 4 half steps), perfect fifth (7 half steps), or octave. (See Interval to learn how

to determine and name the interval between any two notes.)

An interval is measured between two notes. When there are more than two notes

sounding at the same time, that's a chord. (See Triads (Page 157), Naming Triads (Page

159), and Beyond Triads: Naming Other Chords (Page 165) for some basics on chords.)

Of course, you can still talk about the interval between any two of the notes in a chord.

The simple intervals that are considered to be consonant are the minor third, major

third, perfect fourth, perfect fifth, minor sixth, major sixth, and the octave.

In modern Western Music, all of these intervals are considered to be pleasing to the

ear. Chords that contain only these intervals are considered to be "stable", restful chords that don't need to be resolved. When we hear them, we don't feel a need for

them to go to other chords.

The intervals that are considered to be dissonant are the minor second, the major

second, the minor seventh, the major seventh, and particularly the tritone, which is

the interval in between the perfect fourth and perfect fifth.

These intervals are all considered to be somewhat unpleasant or tension-producing.

In tonal music, chords containing dissonances are considered "unstable"; when we

hear them, we expect them to move on to a more stable chord. Moving from a

dissonance to the consonance that is expected to follow it is called resolution, or

resolving the dissonance. The pattern of tension and release created by resolved

dissonances is part of what makes a piece of music exciting and interesting. Music that

contains no dissonances can tend to seem simplistic or boring. On the other hand,

music that contains a lot of dissonances that are never resolved (for example, much of

twentieth-century "classical" or "art" music) can be difficult for some people to listen

to, because of the unreleased tension.

Figure 5.21 Resolving Dissonances In most music a dissonance will resolve; it will be followed by a

consonant chord that it naturally leads to, for example a G seventh chord resolves to a C major chord24,

and a D suspended fourth resolves to a D major chord25. A series of unresolved dissonances26, on the

other hand, can produce a sense of unresolved tension.

Why are some note combinations consonant and some dissonant? Preferences for

certain sounds is partly cultural; that's one of the reasons why the traditional musics

of various cultures can sound so different from each other. Even within the tradition

of Western music, opinions about what is unpleasantly dissonant have changed a

great deal over the centuries. But consonance and dissonance do also have a strong physical basis in nature.

In simplest terms, the sound waves of consonant notes "fit" together much better

than the sound waves of dissonant notes. For example, if two notes are an octave

apart, there will be exactly two waves of one note for every one wave of the other

note. If there are two and a tenth waves or eleven twelfths of a wave of one note for

every wave of another note, they don't fit together as well. For much more about the

physical basis of consonance and dissonance, see Acoustics for Music Theory,

Harmonic Series, and Tuning Systems.

This skill is necessary for those studying music theory. It's also very useful at a

"practical" level for composers, arrangers, and performers (especially people playing

chords, like pianists and guitarists), who need to be able to talk to each other about

the chords that they are reading, writing, and playing.

Chord manuals, fingering charts, chord diagrams, and notes written out on a staff are

all very useful, especially if the composer wants a very particular sound on a chord.

But all you really need to know are the name of the chord, your major scales and

minor scales, and a few rules, and you can figure out the notes in any chord for

yourself.

What do you need to know to be able to name most chords?

1. You must know your major, minor, augmented and diminished triads. Either have

them all memorized, or be able to figure them out following the rules for triads.

(See Triads (Page 157) and Naming Triads (Page 159).)

2. You must be able to find intervals from the root of the chord. One way to do this

is by using the rules for intervals. (See Interval (Page 124).) Or if you know your

scales and don't want to learn about intervals, you can use the method in #3

instead.

If you know all your scales (always a good thing to know, for so many reasons),

you can find all the intervals from the root using scales. For example, the "4" in

Csus4 is the 4th note in a

4. C (major or minor) scale, and the "minor 7th" in Dm7 is the 7th note in a D

(natural) minor scale. If you would prefer this method, but need to brush up on your scales, please see Major

5. Major Keys and Scales (Page 115) and Minor Keys and Scales (Page 118).

6. You need to know the rules for the common seventh chords, for extending and

altering chords, for adding notes, and for naming bass notes. The basic rules for

these are all found below.

Note: Please note that the modern system of chord symbols, discussed below,

is very different from the figured bass shorthand popular in the seventeenth century (which is not discussed here). For example, the "6" in figured bass

notation implies the first inversion chord, not an added 6. (As of this writing,

Some instrumentalists, such as guitarists and pianists, are sometimes expected to be

able to play a named chord, or an accompaniment (Accompaniment) based on that

chord, without seeing the notes written out in common notation. In such cases, a

chord symbol above the staff tells the performer what chord should be used as

accompaniment to the music until the next symbol appears.

Figure 5.22 Chord Symbols A chord symbol above the staff is sometimes the only indication of which notes

should be used in the accompaniment (Accompaniment). Chord symbols also may be used even when an

accompaniment is written out, so that performers can read either the chord symbol or the notated music,

as they prefer.

There is widespread agreement on how to name chords, but there are several

different systems for writing chord symbols. Unfortunately, this can be a little

confusing, particularly when different systems use the same symbol to refer to

different chords. If you're not certain what chord is wanted, you can get useful clues

both from the notes in the music and from the other chord symbols used. (For

example, if the "minus" chord symbol is used, check to see if you can spot any chords

that are clearly labelled as either minor or diminished.)

The seventh is not the only note you can add to a basic triad to get a new chord. You

can continue to extend the chord by adding to the stack of thirds (Section 5.1), or you

can add any note you want. The most common additions and extensions add notes

that are in the scale named by the chord.

Figure 5.24 Extending and Adding Notes to Chords To find out what to call a note added to a chord,

count the notes of the scale named by the chord.

The first, third, and fifth (1, 3, and 5) notes of the scale are part of the basic triad. So

are any other notes in other octaves that have the same name as 1, 3, or 5. In a C

major chord, for example, that would be any C naturals, E naturals, and G naturals. If

you want to add a note with a different name, just list its number (its scale degree)

after the name of the chord.

Figure 5.25 Adding to and Extending Chords Labelling a number as "sus" (suspended) implies that it

replaces the chord tone immediately below it. Labelling it "add" implies that only that note is added. In

many other situations, the performer is left to decide how to play the chord most effectively. Chord tones

may or may not be left out. In an extended chord, all or some of the notes in the "stack of thirds" below the

named note may also be added.

Many of the higher added notes are considered extensions of the "stack of thirds"

begun in the triad. In other words, a C13 can include (it's sometimes the performer's

decision which notes will actually be played) the seventh, ninth, and eleventh as well

as the thirteenth. Such a chord can be dominant, major, or minor; the performer must

take care to play the correct third and seventh. If a chord symbol says to "add13", on

the other hand, this usually means that only the thirteenth is added.

the other hand, this usually means that only the thirteenth is added.

Figure 5.26 A Variety of Ninth Chords Take care to use the correct third and seventh - dominant, major, or

minor â with extended chords. If the higher note is labelled "add", don't include the chord extensions that

aren't named.

Note: All added notes and extensions, including sevenths, introduce

dissonance into the chord. In some modern music, many of these dissonances

are heard as pleasant or interesting or jazzy and don't need to be resolved.

However, in other styles of music, dissonances need to be resolved, and some

chords may be altered to make the dissonance sound less harsh (for example,

by leaving out the 3 in a chord with a 4).

You may have noticed that, once you pass the octave (8), you are repeating the scale.

In other words, C2 and C9 both add a D, and C4 and C11 both add an F. It may seem

that C4 and C11 should therefore be the same chords, but in practice these chords

that C4 and C11 should therefore be the same chords, but in practice these chords

usually do sound different; for example, performers given a C4 chord will put the

added note near the bass note and often use it

as a temporary replacement for the third (the "3") of the chord. On the other hand,

they will put the added note of a C11 at the top of the chord, far away from the bass

note and piled up on top of all the other notes of the chord (including the third), which

may include the 7 and 9 as well as the 11. The result is that the C11 - an extension -

has a more diffuse, jazzy, or impressionistic sound. The C4, on the other hand, has a

more intense, needs-to-be-resolved, classic suspension sound. In fact, 2, 4, and 9

chords are often labelled suspended (sus), and follow the same rules for resolution

(pg 185) in popular music as they do in classical.

name, for example C/E. The note following the slash should be the bass note.

Figure 5.28 Naming the Bass Note The note following the slash is the bass note of the chord. It can be a

note that is already in the chord - making the chord a first or second inversion (pg 176) - or it can be an

added note, following the same basic rules as other added notes (including using it to replace other notes in

the chord).

The note named as the bass note can be a note normally found in the chord - for

example, C/E or C/G - or it can be an added note - for example C/B or C/A. If the bass

note is not named, it is best to use the tonic as the primary bass note.

For guitarists, pianists, and other chord players: Get some practical practice. Name

some chords you don't have memorized (maybe F6, Am/G, Fsus4, BM7, etc.). Chords

with fingerings that you don't know but with a sound that you would recognize work

best for this exercise. Decide what notes must be in those chords, find a practical

fingering for them, play the notes and see what they sound like.

If a note in the chord is not in the major or minor scale of the root of the chord, it is an

altered note and makes the chord an altered chord. The alteration - for example "flat

five" or "sharp nine" - is listed in the chord symbol. Any number of alterations can be

listed, making some chord symbols quite long. Alterations are not the same as

accidentals. Remember, a chord symbol always names notes in the scale of the chord

It sounds like a very technical idea, but basic harmonic analysis just means

understanding how a chord is related to the key and to the other chords in a piece of

music. This can be such useful information that you will find many musicians who

have not studied much music theory, and even some who don't read music, but who

can tell you what the I ("one") or the V ("five") chord are in a certain key.

Why is it useful to know how chords are related?

Many Form (Page 181) (for example, a "twelve bar blues") follow very specific

chord progressions (Chords), which are often discussed in terms of harmonic

relationships.

If you are searching for chords to go with a particular melody (in a particular key),

it is very helpful to know what chords are most likely in that key, and how they

might be likely to progress from one to another.



Improvisation requires an understanding of the chord progression.

Harmonic analysis is also necessary for anyone who wants to be able to compose

reasonable chord progressions or to study and understand the music of the great

composers.

Any chord might show up in any key, but some chords are much more likely than

others. The most likely chords to show up in a key are the chords that use only the

notes in that key (no accidentals ). So these chords have both names and numbers

that tell how they fit into the key. (We'll just discuss basic triads for the moment, not

seventh chords or other addednote or altered chords.) The chords are numbered

using Roman numerals from I to vii.

Figure 5.31 Chords in the keys of C major and D major To find all the basic chords in a key, build a simple

triad (in the key) on each note of the scale. You'll find that although the chords change from one key to the

next, the pattern of major and minor chords is always the same.

You can find all the basic triads that are possible in a key by building one triad, in the

key, on each note of the scale (each scale degree). One easy way to name all these

chords is just to number them: the chord that starts on the first note of the scale is "I",

the chord that starts on the next scale degree is "ii", and so on. Roman numerals are

numerals followed by a small circle. Because major scales always follow the same

pattern, the pattern of major and minor chords is also the same in any major key. The

chords built on the first, fourth, and fifth degrees of the scale are always major chords

(I, IV, and V). The chords built on the second, third, and sixth degrees of the scale are

always minor chords (ii, iii, and vi). The chord built on the seventh degree of the scale

is a diminished chord.

Note: Notice that IV in the key of B flat is an E flat major chord, not an E major

chord, and vii in the key of G is F sharp diminished, not F diminished. If you

can't name the scale notes in a key, you may find it difficult to predict whether

a chord should be based on a sharp, flat, or natural note. This is only one

reason (out of many) why it is a good idea to memorize all the scales. (See

Even among the chords that naturally occur in a key signature, some are much more

likely to be used than others. In most music, the most common chord is I. In Western

music (Section 2.8), I is the Tonal Center (Page 116) of the music, the chord that feels

like the "home base" of the music.

As the other two major chords in the key, IV and V are also likely to be very common.

Minor Intervals) added (V7). It is so common that this particular flavor of seventh

(Section 5.4.3) (a major chord with a minor seventh added) is often called a dominant

seventh, regardless of whether the chord is being used as the V (the dominant) of the

key. Whereas the I chord feels most strongly "at home", V7 gives the strongest feeling

of "time to head home now". This is very useful for giving music a satisfying ending.

Although it is much less common than the V7, the diminished vii chord (often with a

diminished seventh added), is considered to be a harmonically unstable chord that

strongly wants to resolve to I. Listen to these very short progressions and see how

strongly each suggests that you must be in the key of C:

seventh chord to C chord (V7 - I)44; B diminished seventh chord to C chord (viidim7 -

(or V7) chords of a key, a fact greatly appreciated by many beginning guitar players.

Figure 5.32 Some chord progressions Much Western music is harmonically pretty simple, so it can be very

useful just to know I, IV, and V in your favorite keys. This figure shows progressions as a list of chords (read

left to right as if reading a paragraph), one per measure.

A lot of folk music, blues, rock, marches, and even some classical music is based on

simple chord progressions, but of course there is plenty of music that has more

complicated harmonies. Pop and jazz in particular often include many chords with

added or altered notes.

Classical music also tends to use more complex chords in greater variety, and is very

likely to use chords that are not in the key.

So far we have concentrated on identifying chord relationships by number, because

this system is commonly used by musicians to talk about every kind of music from

classical to jazz to blues. There is another set of names that is commonly used,

particularly in classical music, to talk about harmonic relationships. Because numbers

are used in music to identify everything from beats to intervals to harmonics to what

fingering to use, this naming system is sometimes less confusing.

Sometimes a piece of music temporarily moves into a new key. This is called

modulation. It is very common in traditional classical music; long symphony and

concerto movements almost always spend at least some time in a different key

minor or relative major), to keep things interesting. Shorter works, even in classical

style, are less likely to have complete modulations. In most styles of music, a slow,

gradual modulation to the new key (and back) seems more natural, and abrupt

modulations can seem unpleasant and jarring. But implied modulations, in which the

tonal center seems to suddenly shift for a short time, can be very common in some

shorter works (jazz standards, for example). As in longer works, modulation, with its new set of chords, is a good way to keep a piece interesting. If you find that the chord

progression in a piece of music suddenly contains many chords that you would not

expect in that key, it may be that the piece has modulated. Lots of accidentals, or even

an actual change of key signature, are other clues that the music has modulated.

A new key signature may help you to identify the modulation key. If there is not a

A new key signature may help you to identify the modulation key. If there is not a

change of key signature, remember that the new key is likely to contain whatever

accidentals are showing up. It is also likely that many of the chords in the progression

will be chords that are common in the new key. Look particularly for tonic chords and

dominant sevenths. The new key is likely to be closely related to the original key, but

another favorite trick in popular music is to simply move the key up one whole step,

for example from C major to D major.

Although the concept of harmonic analysis is pretty basic, actually analyzing complex

pieces can be a major challenge. This is one of the main fields of study for those who

are interested in studying music theory at a more advanced level. One next step for

those interested in the subject is to become familiar with all the ways notes may be

added to basic triads. (Please see Beyond Triads for an introduction to that subject.) At

that point, you may want to spend some time practicing analyzing some simple,

familiar pieces. As of this writing, the site Music Theory for Songwriters featured

"chord maps" that help the student predict likely chord progressions.

For more advanced practice, look for music theory books that focus entirely on

harmony or that spend plenty of time analyzing harmonies in real music. (Some music

history textbooks are in this category.) You will progress more quickly if you can find

A cadence is any place in a piece of music that has the feel of an ending point. This can

be either a strong, definite stopping point - the end of the piece, for example, or the

end of a movement or a verse - but it also refers to the "temporary-resting-place"

pauses that round off the ends of musical ideas within each larger section.

A musical phrase, like a sentence, usually contains an understandable idea, and then

pauses before the next idea starts. Some of these musical pauses are simply take-a-

breathtype pauses, and don't really give an "ending" feeling. In fact, like questions that

need answers, many phrases leave the listener with a strong expectation of hearing

the next, "answering", phrase.

are one of the main sources of the listener's enjoyment of the music.

Like a story, a piece of music can come to an end by simply stopping, but most

listeners will react to such abruptness with dissatisfaction: the story or music simply

"stopped" instead of "ending" properly. A more satisfying ending, in both stories and

music, is usually provided by giving clues that an end is coming, and then ending in a

commonly-accepted way. Stories are also divided into paragraphs, chapters, stanzas,

scenes, or episodes, each with their own endings, to help us keep track of things and

understand what is going on. Music also groups phrases and motifs into verses,

choruses, sections, and movements, marked off by strong cadences to help us keep

track of them. In good stories, there are clues in the plot and the pacing - in the

they deserve, the inevitable tragedy occurs, or misunderstandings get resolved - that

signal that the end of the story is nearing.

Similarly, in music there are clues that signal to the listener that the end is coming up.

These clues may be in the form; in the development of the musical ideas; in the

music's Tempo (Page 41), Texture (Page 68), or Rhythm (Page 60) complexity; in the

even in the number and length of the phrases (Western listeners are fond of powers

of two). Like the ending of a story, an ending in music is more satisfying if it follows

certain customs that the listener expects to hear. If you have grown up listening to a

particular musical tradition, you will automatically have these expectations for a piece

of music, even if you are not aware of having them. And like the customs for

storytelling, these expectations can be different in different musical traditions.

Some things that produce a feeling of cadence

Harmony - In most Western and Western-influenced music (including jazz and

"world" musics), harmony is by far the most important signal of cadence. One of

the most fundamental "rules" of the major-minor harmony system is that music

ends on the tonic. A tonal piece of music will almost certainly end on the tonic

chord, although individual phrases or sections may end on a different chord (the

---
chord, although individual phrases or sections may end on a different chord (the

dominant is a popular choice). But a composer cannot just throw in a tonic chord

and expect it to sound like an ending; the harmony must "lead up to" the ending

and make it feel inevitable (just as a good story makes the ending feel inevitable,

even if it's a surprise). So the term cadence, in tonal music, usually refers to the

"ending" chord plus the short chord progression (Chords) that led up to it. There

are many different terms in use for the most common tonal cadences; you will

find the most common terms below (Some Tonal Cadence Terms). Some (but not

all) modal musics also use harmony to indicate cadence, but the cadences used

can be quite different from those in tonal harmony.

Melody - In the major/minor tradition, the melody will normally end on some note

of the tonic chord triad, and a melody ending on the tonic will give a stronger

of the tonic chord triad, and a melody ending on the tonic will give a stronger

(more final-sounding) cadence than one ending on the third or fifth of the chord.

In some modal musics, the melody plays the most important role in the cadence.

Like a scale, each mode also has a home note, where the melody is expected to

end. A mode often also has a formula that the melody usually uses to arrive at the ending note. For example, it may be typical of one mode to go to the final

note from the note one whole tone below it; whereas in another mode the

have more than one possible melodic cadence, or its typical cadence may be

more complex.)

Rhythm - Changes in the rhythm, a break or pause in the rhythm, a change in the

tempo, or a slowing of or pause in the harmonic rhythm (Chords) are also

commonly found at a cadence.

Texture - Changes in the texture of the music also often accompany a cadence. For

example, the music may momentarily switch from harmony to unison or from

counterpoint to a simpler block-chord homophony.

indicate where the next cadence is going to be - every eight measures for a

certain type of dance, for example. (When you listen to a piece of music, you

actually expect and listen for these regularly-spaced cadences, at least

subconsciously. An accomplished composer may "tease" you by seeming to lead

to a cadence in the expected place, but then doing domething unexpected

instead.)

take up an entire course at the college-musicmajor level. Complicating matters is the

fact that there are several competing systems for naming cadences. This introductory

course cannot go very deeply into this subject, and so will only touch on the common

terms used when referring to cadences. Unfortunately, the various naming systems

may use the same terms to mean different things, so even a list of basic terms is a bit

confusing.

Complete Cadence - same as authentic cadence.

Deceptive Cadence - This refers to any time that the music seems to lead up to a

cadence, but then doesn't actually land on the expected tonic, and also often

does not bring the expected pause in the music.

False Cadence - Same as deceptive cadence.

Full Close - Same as authentic cadence.

Half-cadence - May refer to a cadence that ends on the dominant chord (V). This

type of cadence is more common at pause-type cadences than at full-stop ones.

OR may have same meaning as plagal cadence.

Half close - Same as plagal cadence.



Imperfect Cadence - May refer to an authentic (V-I) cadence in which the chord is

not in root position, or the melody does not end on the tonic. OR may mean a

cadence that ends on the dominant chord (same as one meaning of half-

cadence).

Interrupted Cadence - Same as deceptive cadence.

Perfect Cadence - Same as authentic cadence. As its name suggests, this is

considered the strongest, most final-sounding cadence. Some do not consider a

cadence to be completely perfect unless the melody ends on the tonic and both

chords (V and I) are in root position (Section 5.1).

Plagal Cadence - A subdominant (Section 5.5.4) chord followed by a tonic chord

(IV-I). For many people, this cadence will be familiar as the "Amen" chords at the

end of many traditional hymns.

Every piece of music has an overall plan or structure, the "big picture", so to speak.

This is called the form of the music.

It is easy to recognize and grasp the form of some things, because they are small and

simple, like a grain of salt, or repetitive, like a wall made of bricks of the same size.

Other forms are easy to understand because they are so familiar; if you see dogs

more often than you do sea cucumbers, it should be easier for you to recognize the

form of an unfamiliar dog than of an unfamiliar sea cucumber. Other things, like a

forest ecosystem, or the structure of a government, are so complex that they have to

be explored or studied before their structure can be understood.

Musical forms offer a great range of complexity. Most listeners will quickly grasp the

form of a short and simple piece, or of one built from many short repetitions. It is also

easier to recognize familiar musical forms. The average American, for example, can

easier to recognize familiar musical forms. The average American, for example, can

distinguish easily between the verses and refrain of any pop song, but will have

trouble recognizing what is going on in a piece of music for Balinese gamelan.

forms which may be difficult to recognize without the familiarity that comes from

study or repeated hearings.

You can enjoy music without recognizing its form, of course. But understanding the

form of a piece helps a musician put together a more credible performance of it.

Anyone interested in music theory or history, or in arranging or composing music,

must have a firm understanding of form. And being able to "see the big picture" does

help the listener enjoy the music even more.

Musicians traditionally have two ways to describe the form of a piece of music. One

way involves labelling each large section with a letter. The other way is to simply give a

name to a form that is very common.

same as the first, it is also labelled A. If it is very much like the A section, but with some

important differences, it can be labelled A' (pronounced "A prime"). The A' section can

also show up later in the piece, or yet another variation of A, A" (pronounced "A

double prime") can show up, and so on.

The first major section of the piece that is very different from A is labelled B, and other

sections that are like it can be labelled B, B', B", and so on. Sections that are not like A

or B are labelled C, and so on.

How do you recognize the sections? With familiar kinds of music, this is pretty easy.

(See the below Figure 5.38 for some examples of forms that will be familiar to most

listeners.) With unfamiliar types of music, it can be more of a challenge. Whether the

music is classical, modern, jazz, or pop, listen for repeated sections of music. Also,

listen for big changes, in the rhythm, melody, harmony , texture, and timbre. A new

section that is not a repetition will usually have noticeable differences in more than

one of these areas. For an excellent discussion of form, with plenty of chances to

practice hearing the beginnings of new sections, please see Professor Brandt's Sound

Reasoning course. In particular, Musical Form56 deals with recognizing when

something new is being introduced (A/B instead of A only), and Time's Effect on the

Material deals with recognizing when a section reappears changed (A', B', or Aâ).

Bridge Sections are new material that appears late in the song, usually appearing

only once or twice, often in place of a verse and usually leading into the refrain.

(You may want to note the differences - and the similarity - in the use of the term

bridge by popular musicians and jazz musicians; see below (Some Common

Forms)).

Instrumentals are important sections that have no vocals. They can come at the

beginning or end, or in between other sections. Is there more than one? Do they

have the same melody as a verse or refrain? Are they similar to each other?

While discussing a piece of music in detail, musicians may also use letters to label

smaller parts of the piece within larger sections, even down to labelling individual

phrases. For example, the song "The Girl I Left Behind" has many verses with no

refrain, an A A' A"- type form. However, a look (Figure 5.39) at the tune of one verse

shows that within that overall form is an A A' B A" phrase structure.

smaller sections, and even individual phrases, may also be labelled with letters, in order to discuss the piece

in greater detail. The A A B A form of this verse is very common, found in verses of everything from folk to

jazz to pop music. Verses of blues songs are more likely to have an A A' B form.

to in Exercise 5.19. Listen for phrases that use similar melodies. (Sometimes, but not

an overall plan quite different from a piece called a "rondo". (Specifically, the theme

and variations would follow an A A' A" A"'... plan, with each section being a new

variation on the theme in the first section. A rondo follows an A B A C A ... plan, with a

familiar section returning in between sections of new music.)

Also, many genres of music tend to follow a preset form, like the "typical pop song

form" in Figure 5.39. A symphony, for example, is usually a piece of music written for

a fairly large number of instruments. It is also associated with a particular form, so

knowing that a piece of music is called a symphony should lead you to expect certain

things about it. For example, listeners familiar with the symphonic form expect a piece

called a symphony to have three or four (depending on when it was written) main

sections, called movements. They expect a moment of silence in between

movements, and also expect the movements to sound very different from each other;

---
movements, and also expect the movements to sound very different from each other;

for example if the first movement is fast and loud, they might expect that the second

movement would be slow and quiet. If they have heard many symphonies, they also

would not be at all surprised if the first movement is in sonata form and the third

movement is based on a dance.

Note: Although a large group of people who play classical music together is often called a symphony, the more accurate term for the group is orchestra.

The confusion occurs because many orchestras call themselves "symphony

orchestras" because they spend so much time playing symphonies (as opposed

to, for example, an "opera orchestra" or a "pops orchestra").

Other kinds of music are also so likely to follow a particular overall plan that they have

become associated with a particular form. You can hear musicians talk about

something being concerto form or sonata form, for example (even if the piece is not

technically a concerto or sonata). Particular dances (a minuet, for example), besides

having a set tempo and time signature, will sometimes have a set form that suits the

dance steps. And many marches are similar enough in form that there are names for

the expected sections (first strain, second strain, trio, break strain).

But it is important to remember that forms are not sets of rules that composers are

required to follow. Some symphonies don't have silence between movements, and

some don't use the sonata form in any of their movements. Plenty of marches have been written that don't have a trio section, and the development section of a sonata

movement can take unexpected turns. And hybrid forms, like the sonata rondo, can

form is closely related to the strophic and variation forms. A chord progression

(Chords) in A A B A form (with the B section called the bridge) is repeated many

times. On the first and last repetition, the melody is played or sung, and soloists

improvise during the other repetitions. The overall form of verse-like repetition,

with the melody played only the first and final times, and improvisations on the

other repetitions, is very common in jazz even when the A A B A song form is not

being used.

Rondo - One section returns repeatedly, with a section of new music before each

return. (A B A C A ; sometimes A B A C A B A)

Dance forms - Dance forms usually consist of repeated sections (so there is plenty

of music to dance to), with each section containing a set number of measures

(often four, eight, sixteen, or thirty-two) that fits the dance steps. Some very

structured dance forms (Minuet, for example) are associated even with particular

phrase structures and harmonic progressions within each section.

Binary Form - Two different main sections (A B). Commonly in Western classical

music, the A section will move away from the tonic, with a strong cadence in

another key, and the B section will move back and end strongly in the tonic.

Ternary Form - Three main sections, usually A B A or A B A'.

Cyclic Form - There are two very different uses of this term. One refers to long

multimovement works (a "song cycle", for example) that have an overarching

theme and structure binding them together. It may also refer to a single

movement or piece of music with a form based on the constant repetition of a

single short section. This may be an exact repetition (ostinato) in one part of the

music (for example, the bass line, or the rhythm section), while development,

There is no subtonic in this progression.

It is A minor (with a C natural), not A major (with a C sharp) that belongs in this key.

An A major chord can sound good in the key of G major, however. It is the dominant

of the dominant (D major), so playing an A major chord can sometimes make the

music feel like it has temporarily moved to the (closely related) key of D major. This

type of harmonic complexity helps keep a piece of music interesting.

The III chord would become augmented; the v chord would become major; and the vii

chord would become a diminished sharp seven chord. The major dominant chord

would be most useful in establishing the tonal center of the piece, although the

diminished sharp seven might also sometimes be used for cadences.

When musicians talk about ear, they don't mean the sense organ itself so much as the

brain's ability to perceive, distinguish, and understand what the ear has heard. The

term ear training refers to teaching musicians to recognize information about notes

and chords (Chords) just by hearing them. (You can check your "ear" by trying this ear

training game.)

Minor Chords (Page 160). A few musicians with particularly perceptive ears can even

tell you that a piano is tuned a few cents higher than the one that they play at home.

This is an unusual skill that even most trained musicians do not have, and research

seems to suggest that if you don't have it at a very early age, you cannot develop it.

(For more on this subject, you may want to look up Robert Jourdain's Music, the Brain,

and Ecstasy: How Music Captures our Imagination.)

However, most musicians can be trained to recognize relative pitch. In other words, if

you play two notes, they can tell you that one of them is a major third (Major and

Minor Intervals) higher than the other. If you play four chords (Chords) in a row, they

can tell you that you played a tonic-subdominant-dominant seventh-tonic (I-IV-V7-I)

chord progression (Chords).

Fortunately, having relative pitch is good enough, and for many musicians may even

be more useful than perfect pitch, because of the way Western music is conceived.

Since all major keys are so similar, a piece in a major key will sound almost exactly the same whether you play it in C major or D major. The thing that matters is not what

note you start on, but how all the notes are related to each other and to the "home"

note (the tonic) of the key. If someone really wants the piece to be in a different key

(because it's easier to sing or play in that key, or just because they want it to sound

higher or lower), the whole thing can be transposed, but the only difference that

would make (in the sound) is that the entire piece will sound higher or lower. Most

listeners would not even notice the difference, unless you played it in both keys, one

right after the other.

So, you often don't need to know exactly what notes or chords are being played.

Simply having an ear well-trained in "relative pitch" is extremely useful in many ways.

Guitar and piano players can figure out chord progressions (Chords) just by listening

to them, and then play the progressions in their favorite keys. Other instrumentalists

can play a favorite tune without a written copy of it, just by knowing what the interval

to the next note must be. Composers and music arrangers can jot down a piece of

music without having to "pick it out" on an instrument to find the notes and chords

they want. And of course, ear training is crucial to any musician who wants to play jazz

or any type of improvisation. Given a well-trained "ear", any musical idea that you

"hear" in your head, you can play. And ear training is also crucial for those interested

in music theory, musicology, or just being able to write down a tune accurately.

in music theory, musicology, or just being able to write down a tune accurately.

As with all other musical skills, there are many different levels and kinds of proficiency.

One musician may be very good at "playing by ear", but may not even read music and

cannot name intervals or write the music down. Another may be very good at "taking

dictation" (writing down the music they hear), and yet feel unable to do jazz

improvisation. As always, the key is to practice the particular skills that you want to

develop.

At the beginner level, work with a skilled musician who can teach you how to tune

your instrument and help you identify and fix tuning problems.

Play with other musicians often. (Playing along with recordings does not teach

good tuning skills.) Don't just tune at the beginning of rehearsals and

performances. Listen at all times and be ready to retune any note whenever

necessary.

Spend as much time as necessary tuning whenever you play. Do not (knowingly)

practice while out of tune; if you do, it will slow down your ear training

tremendously. Whenever possible, until you are good at tuning, get someone else

to help you tune every time you play.

Practice tuning quickly and accurately. Learn any alternate fingerings and other

"tricks" available on your instrument for fine-tuning each note as you play.

sound like? Play the same progressions in different keys and listen to how that

ears. Change fingerings and chord voicings, and again listen carefully to how that

Just do it! The best way to learn this skill is to spend some of your practice time

trying to play tunes you know and like.

Once you start getting good at this, see how quickly you can get a new tune down.

How few mistakes can you make the first time you try it? Can you "recover"

quickly from a mistake by making it sound like a bit of improvisation?



If you play a melody instrument (one that plays only one note at a time), there are

different bits of information that help you recognize what the next note will be:

how far it is from the note you are on (see Interval), where it is in the key (see

Beginning Harmonic Analysis) or where it is in the chord (see Triads ). These three

things are all related to each other, of course - and a musician with a well-trained

ear will be aware of all of them, at least subconsciously - but you may find at first

that one works better for you than the others. You may want to experiment: is it

Know your scales and arpeggios. A good improviser, given the name of a chord,

can quickly play not only the notes of the chord but also the scale implied by the

chord. Any decent book on playing jazz, or any teacher familiar with jazz, will

introduce the student to these chords and scales.

There are now many book/CD combinations available to help the beginning

improviser in many different genres and on many different instruments. A good

tunes, and some also introduce the music theory involved. At the time of this

beginning improviser.

Listen to jazz often. Listen to the improvisers you admire, and if a particular solo

really appeals to you, listen to it many times, find the notes on your instrument,

and then try writing it down as accurately as you can. Many famous improvisors,

when interviewed, mention how useful it was to them to learn from other soloists

by transcribing their solos in this way.

Figure out how to play your favorite jazz (or blues or rock) licks (short Motif (Page

Before you can do this, you must know your major and minor keys and scales and

your Intervals. You may also want to understand Transposition: Changing Keys

(Page 218), since you may find it easier to work in some keys than in others.

Here is a game you can play to practice identifying intervals when you hear them.

It's an application (.exe file) that you can play in Windows. Or you can play the

same game with a friend. Sit back-to-back and take turns playing intervals and

guessing what was just played. If you get good at guessing intervals, see if you can

guess the exact notes that were played. (You may be surprised at how well you

can guess the exact notes if they are played on an instrument that you play

often.)

Once again, practice is the best way to become good at this. Start with tunes that

you know well, but don't know what the (written) notes are. Listen to them in your

head (or play a recording) while trying to write them down. Then play what you

have written, noticing where you were correct and where you made mistakes.

Which intervals are you good at hearing? Which do you have trouble identifying?

Do you often mistake one particular interval for another? Do you tend to identify

a note by its interval from the previous note or by its place in the chord or in the

key? Answering these questions will help you improve more quickly.

Some people find it easier to learn to recognize intervals if they associate each

interval with a familiar tune. (For example, in the familiar song from The Sound of

Music that begins "Do, a deer, a female deer...", all the intervals in the phrase "a

female deer" are major thirds, and every interval in the phrase "someday I'll wish

upon a star" in the song "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" is a minor third.) The

tune should be very familiar, so when trying to hear a triton, some people will

prefer thinking of the beginning of "The Simpsons" theme; others will prefer the

beginning of "Maria" fromWest Side Story. If you think this method will work for

you, try playing the interval you are having trouble hearing, and see what tune it

reminds you of.

The first thing musicians must do before they can play together is "tune". For

musicians in the standard Western music tradition, this means agreeing on exactly

what pitch (what frequency) is an "A", what is a "B flat" and so on. Other cultures not

only have different note names and different scales, they may even have different

notes - different pitches - based on a different tuning system. In fact, the modern

Western tuning system, which is called equal temperament, replaced (relatively

recently) other tuning systems that were once popular in Europe. All tuning systems

are based on the physics of sound. But they all are also affected by the history of their

music traditions, as well as by the tuning peculiarities of the instruments used in those

traditions.

Octaves and the Major-Minor Tonal System (Page 107) (say, from C to C) is

divided into twelve equallyspaced notes. "Equally-spaced" to a musician

basically means that each of these notes is one Half Steps and Whole Steps

(Page 111) from the next, and that all half steps sound like the same size pitch

change. (To a scientist or engineer, "equally-spaced" means that the ratio of

the frequencies of the two notes in any half step is always the same.) This tuning system is very convenient for some instruments, such as the piano, and

also makes it very easy to change key without retuning instruments. But a

musical sound. The "equal" ratios of its half steps are the twelfth root of two,

rather than reffecting the simpler ratios produced by the sounds themselves,

and the important intervals that build harmonies can sound slightly out of

tune. This often leads to some "tweaking" of the tuning in real performances,

away from equal temperament. It also leads many other music traditions to

prefer tunings other than equal temperament, particularly tunings in which

some of the important intervals are based on the pure, simple-ratio intervals

of physics. In order to feature these favored intervals, a tuning tradition may:

use scales in which the notes are not equally spaced; avoid any notes or

intervals which don't work with a particular tuning; change the tuning of some

notes when the key or Modes and Ragas (Page 209) changes; or any

Almost all music traditions recognize the octave. When one note has a frequency that

is exactly two times the frequency of a second note, then the first note is one octave

higher than the second note. A simple mathematical way to say this is that the ratio10

of the frequencies is 2:1. Two notes that are exactly one octave apart sound good

together because their frequencies are related in such a simple way. If a note had a

frequency, for example, that was 2.11 times the frequency of another note (instead of

To find other notes that sound "in tune" with each other, we look for other sets of

pitches that have a "simple" frequency relationship. These sets of pitches with closely

related frequencies are often written in common notation as a harmonic series. The

harmonic series is not just a useful idea constructed by music theory; it is often found

in "real life", in the realworld physics of musical sounds. For example, a bugle can play

only the notes of a specific harmonic series. And every musical note you hear is not a

single pure frequency, but is actually a blend of the pitches of a particular harmonic

series. (The relative strengths of the harmonics are what gives the note its timbre. See

Figure 6.1 Harmonic Series on C Here are the first sixteen pitches in a harmonic series that starts on a C

natural. The series goes on indefinitely, with the pitches getting closer and closer together. A harmonic

series can start on any note, so there are many harmonic series, but every harmonic series has the same set

of intervals and the same frequency ratios.

What does it mean to say that two pitches have a "simple frequency relationship"? It

doesn't mean that their frequencies are almost the same. Two notes whose

frequencies are almost the same - say, the frequency of one is 1.005 times the other -

sound bad together. Again, when we hear them, we say they are "out of tune". Notes

with a close relationship have frequencies that can be written as a ratio12 of two small

whole numbers; the smaller the numbers, the more closely related the notes are. Two

notes that are exactly the same pitch, for example, have a frequency ratio of 1:1, and

octaves, as we have already seen, are 2:1. Notice that when two pitches are related in

this simple-ratio way, it means that they can be considered part of the same harmonic

series, and in fact the actual harmonic series of the two notes may also overlap and

reinforce each other. The fact that the two notes are complementing and reinforcing

reinforce each other. The fact that the two notes are complementing and reinforcing

each other in this way, rather than presenting the human ear with two completely

different harmonic series, may be a major reason why they sound consonant and "in

tune".

Note: Notice that the actual frequencies of the notes do not matter. What matters is

how they compare to each other - basically, how many waves of one note go by for

each wave of the other note. Although the actual frequencies of the notes will change

for every harmonic series, the comparison between the notes will be the same.

note in the series â the fundamental. For example, the frequency of the note

numbered 3 in Figure 6.1 is three times the frequency of the fundamental, and the

frequency of the note numbered fifteen is fifteen times the frequency of the

fundamental. In the example, the fundamental is a C. That note's frequency times

2 gives you another C; times 2 again (4) gives another C; times 2 again gives another C

(8), and so on. Now look at the G's in this series. The first one is number 3 in the

series. 3 times 2 is 6, and number 6 in the series is also a G. So is number 12 (6 times

2). Check for yourself the other notes in the series that are an octave apart. You will

find that the ratio for one octave (Section 4.1) is always 2:1, just as the ratio for a

unison is always 1:1. Notes with this small-number ratio of 2:1 are so closely related

that we give them the same name, and most tuning systems are based on this octave

relationship.

lowest ratio, 4:3, gives the interval of a perfect fourth. Again, these pitches are so

closely related and sound so good together that their intervals have been named

"perfect". The perfect fifth figures prominently in many tuning systems, and, in

Western music, all major and minor chords are based on the perfect fifth. (See Triads

already recognized the simple arithmetical relationship involved in intervals of

octaves, fifths, and fourths. He and his followers believed that numbers were the

ruling principle of the universe, and that musical harmonies were a basic expression

of the mathematical laws of the universe. Their model of the universe involved the

"celestial spheres" making a kind of harmony as they moved in circles dictated by the

same arithmetical relationships as musical harmonies.

In the Pythagorean system, all tuning is based on the interval of the pure fifth. Pure

intervals are the ones found in the harmonic series, with very simple frequency

ratios. So a pure fifth will have a frequency ratio of exactly 3:2. Using a series of

perfect fifths (and assuming perfect octaves, too, so that you are filling in every octave

as you go), you can eventually fill in an entire chromatic scale.

Figure 6.2 Pythagorean Intonation You can continue this series of perfect fifths to get the rest of the

notes of a chromatic scale; the series would continue F sharp, C sharp, and so on.

The main weakness of the Pythagorean system is that a series of pure perfect fifths

will never take you to a note that is a pure octave above the note you started on. To

see why this is a problem, imagine beginning on a C. A series of perfect fifths would

give: C, G, D, A, E, B, F sharp, C sharp, G sharp, D sharp, A sharp, E sharp, and B sharp.

In equal temperament (which doesn't use pure fifths), that B sharp would be exactly

the same pitch as the C seven octaves above where you started (so that the series can,

in essence, be turned into a closed loop, the The Circle of Fifths (Page 137)).

Unfortunately, the B sharp that you arrive at after a series of pure fifths is a little

higher than that C.

So in order to keep pure octaves, instruments that use Pythagorean tuning have to

use eleven pure fifths and one smaller fifth . The smaller fifth has traditionally been

called awolf fifth because of its unpleasant sound. Keys that avoid the wolf fifth sound

just fine on instruments that are tuned this way, but keys in which the wolf fifth is

often heard become a problem. To avoid some of the harshness of the wolf intervals,

some harpsichords and other keyboard instruments were built with split keys for D

sharp/E flat and for G sharp/A flat. The front half of the key would play one note, and

the back half the other (differently tuned) note.

Pythagorean tuning was widely used in medieval and Renaissance times. Major

seconds and thirds are larger in Pythagorean intonation than in equal temperament,

and minor seconds and thirds are smaller. Some people feel that using such intervals

in medieval music is not only more authentic, but sounds better too, since the music

was composed for this tuning system.

Intervals) are simply too far away from the pure major and minor thirds of the

harmonic series. In medieval music, the third was considered a dissonance and was

used sparingly - and actually, when you're using Pythagorean tuning, it really is a

dissonance - but modern harmonies are built mainly on thirds (see Triads (Page 157)).

Some modern Non-Western music traditions, which have a very different approach to

melody and harmony, still base their tuning on the perfect fifth. Wolf fifths and ugly

thirds are not a problem in these traditions, which build each mode within the

framework of the perfect fifth, retuning for different modes as necessary. To read a

little about one such tradition, please see Indian Classical Music: Tuning and Ragas.

The mean-tone system, in order to have pleasant-sounding thirds, takes rather the

opposite approach from the Pythagorean. It uses the pure major third (Major and

Minor Intervals). In this system, the whole tone (or Half Steps and Whole Steps (Page

111)) is considered to be exactly half of the pure major third (this is the "mean", or

average, tone, that gives the system its name). A semitone (or Half Steps and Whole

Steps (Page 111)) is exactly half of a whole tone.

These smaller intervals all work out well in mean-tone tuning, but the result is a fifth

that is noticeably smaller than a pure fifth. And a series of pure thirds will also

eventually not line up with pure octaves, so an instrument tuned this way will also

have a problem with wolf intervals.

As mentioned above, Pythagorean tuning made sense in medieval times, when music

was dominated by fifths. Once the concept of harmony in thirds took hold, thirds became the most important interval; simple perfect fifths were now heard as

"austere" and, well, medieval-sounding. So mean-tone tuning was very popular in

Europe in the 16th through 18th centuries.

But fifths can't be avoided entirely. A basic major or minor chord, for example, is built

of two thirds, but it also has a perfect fifth between its outer two notes (see triads). So

even while mean-tone tuning was enjoying great popularity, some composers and

musicians were searching for other solutions.

9/8 = 1.125

10/9 = 1.111

11/10 = 1.1

Note: In case you are curious, the size of the whole tone of the "mean tone"

system is also the mean, or average, of the major and minor whole tones.

These are fairly small differences, but they can still be heard easily by the human ear.

Just intonation uses both the 9:8 whole tone, which is called a major whole tone and

the 10:9 whole tone, which is called a minor whole tone, in order to construct both

pure thirds and pure fifths. Because chords are constructed of thirds and fifths (see

Triads (Page 157)), this tuning makes typical Western harmonies particularly pleasing

to the ear.

The problem with just intonation is that it matters which steps of the scale are major

whole tones and which are minor whole tones, so an instrument tuned exactly to play

with just intonation in the key of C major will have to retune to play in C sharp major

or D major. For instruments that can tune almost instantly, like voices, violins, and

trombones, this is not a problem; but it is unworkable for pianos, harps, and other

instruments that cannot make small tuning adjustments quickly.

As of this writing, there was useful information about various tuning systems at

several different websites, including The Development of Musical Tuning Systems,

where one could hear what some intervals sound like in the different tuning systems,

and Kyle Gann's Just Intonation Explained, which included some audio samples of

works played in just intonation.

There are times when tuning is not much of an issue. When a good choir sings in

harmony without instruments, they will tune without even thinking about it. All chords

will tend towards pure fifths and thirds, as well as seconds, fourths, sixths, and

sevenths that reflect the harmonic series. Instruments that can bend most pitches

enough to fine-tune them during a performance - and this includes most orchestral

instruments - also tend to play the "pure" intervals. This can happen unconsciously, or

it can be deliberate, as when a conductor asks for an interval to be "expanded" or

"contracted".

key - G major - but badly out of tune in a "distant" key like D flat major. Adding split

keys or extra keys can help (this was a common solution for a time), but also makes

the instrument more difficult to play. In Western music, the tuning systems that have

been invented and widely used that directly address this problem are the various

temperaments, in which the tuning of notes is "tempered" slightly from pure intervals.

(Non-Western music traditions have their own tuning systems, which is too big a

subject to address here.)

As mentioned above (pg 226), the various tuning systems based on pure intervals

eventually have to include "wolf" intervals that make some keys unpleasant or even

unusable. The various well temperament tunings that were very popular in the 18th

and 19th centuries tried to strike a balance between staying close to pure intervals

and avoiding wolf intervals. A well temperament might have several pure fifths, for

example, and several fifths that are smaller than a pure fifth, but not so small that

they are "wolf" fifths. In such systems, tuning would be noticeably different in each

key, but every key would still be pleasant-sounding and usable. This made well

temperaments particularly welcome for players of difficult-to-tune instruments like

Note: Historically, there has been some confusion as to whether or not well

temperament and equal temperament are the same thing, possibly because

well temperaments were sometimes referred to at the time as "equal

temperament". But these well temperaments made all keys equally useful, not

equal-sounding as modern equal temperament does.

As mentioned above, mean-tone tuning was still very popular in the eighteenth

century. J. S. Bach wrote his famous "Well-Tempered Klavier" in part as a plea and

advertisement to switch to a well temperament system. Various well temperaments

did become very popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and much of the

keyboard-instrument music of those centuries may have been written to take advantage of the tuning characteristics of particular keys in particular well

temperaments. It is interesting to note that the different keys in a well temperament

tuning were sometimes considered to be aligned with specific colors and emotions. In

even for voice and for instruments that are more likely to play using just intonation

when they can (see above). In equal temperament, only octaves are pure intervals.

The octave is divided into twelve equally spaced half steps, and all other intervals are

measured in half steps. This gives, for example, a fifth that is a bit smaller than a pure

fifth, and a major third (Major and Minor Intervals) that is larger than the pure major

third. The differences are smaller than the wolf tones found in other tuning systems,

but they are still there.

Equal temperament is well suited to music that changes key often, is very chromatic,

or is harmonically complex. It is also the obvious choice for atonal music that steers

away from identification with any key or tonality at all. Equal temperament has a clear

scientific/mathematical basis, is very straightforward, does not require retuning for

key changes, and is unquestioningly accepted by most people. However, because of

key changes, and is unquestioningly accepted by most people. However, because of

the lack of pure intervals, some musicians find it unsatisfying. As mentioned above,

just intonation is sometimes substituted for equal temperament when practical. Some

musicians would also like to reintroduce well temperaments, at least for

performances of the music which was written for well-tempered instruments.

In a way, equal temperament is a compromise between the Pythagorean approach

and the meantone approach. Neither the third nor the fifth is pure, but neither of

them is terribly far off, either. Because equal temperament divides the octave into

twelve equal semi-tones (half steps), the frequency ratio of each semi-tone is the

twelfth root of 2. If you do not understand why it is the twelfth root of 2 rather than,

say, one twelfth, please see the explanation below. (There is a review of powers and

roots in Powers, Roots, and Equal Temperament16 if you need it.)

Figure 6.4 Equal temperament In equal temperament, the ratio of frequencies in a semitone (half step) is

the twelfth root of two. Every interval is then simply a certain number of semitones. Only the octave (the

twelfth power of the twelfth root) is a pure interval.

because most of the intervals it gives actually fall quite close to the pure intervals. To

see that this is so, look at Figure 6.5. Equal temperament and pure intervals are

calculated as decimals and compared to each other. (You can find these decimals for

yourself using a calculator.)

again at Harmonic Series on C to see where pure interval ratios come from. The ratios for equal

temperament are all multiples of the twelfth root of two. Both sets of ratios are converted to decimals (to

the nearest ten thousandth), so you can easily compare them.

Except for the unison and the octave, none of the ratios for equal temperament are

exactly the same as for the pure interval. Many of them are reasonably close, though.

In particular, perfect fourths and fifths and major thirds are not too far from the pure

intervals. The intervals that are the furthest from the pure intervals are the major

seventh, minor seventh, and minor second (intervals that are considered Consonance

and Dissonance (Page 162) anyway).

Because equal temperament is now so widely accepted as standard tuning, musicians

do not usually even speak of intervals in terms of ratios. Instead, tuning itself is now

defined in terms of equal-temperament, with tunings and intervals measured in cents.

A cent is 1/100 (the hundredth root) of an equal-temperament semitone. In this system, for example, the major whole tone discussed above measures 204 cents, the

minor whole tone 182 cents, and a pure fifth is 702 cents.

Why is a cent the hundredth root of a semitone, and why is a semitone the twelfth

root of an octave? If it bothers you that the ratios in equal temperament are roots,

remember the pure octaves and fifths of the harmonic series.

Figure 6.6 Frequency Relationships Remember that, no matter what note you start on, the note one

octave higher has 2 times its frequency. Also, no matter what note you start on, the note that is a perfect

fifth higher has exactly one and a half times its frequency. Since each of these intervals is so many "times" in

terms of frequencies, when you add intervals, you multiply their frequencies. For example, a series of two

perfect fifths will give a frequency that is 3/2 x 3/2 (or 9/4) the beginning frequency.

Every octave has the same frequency ratio; the higher note will have 2 times the

frequency of the lower note. So if you go up another octave from there (another 2

times), that note must have 2 x 2, or 4 times the frequency of the lowest note. The

next octave takes you up 2 times higher than that, or 8 times the frequency of the first

note, and so on.

In just the same way, in every perfect fifth, the higher note will have a frequency one

and a half (3/2) times the lower note. So to find out how much higher the frequency is

after a series of perfect fifths, you would have to multiply (not add) by one and a half

(3/2) every time you went up another perfect fifth.

All intervals work in this same way. So, in order for twelve semitones (half steps) to

equal one octave, the size of a half step has to be a number that gives the answer "2"

(the size of an octave) when you multiply it twelve times: in other words, the twelfth root of two. And in order for a hundred cents to equal one semitone, the size of a cent

must be the number that, when you multiply it 100 times, ends up being the same size

as a semitone; in other words, the hundredth root of the twelfth root of two. This is

why most musicians prefer to talk in terms of cents and intervals instead of

frequencies.

related to each other by very simple ratios. Physically speaking, this means that the

two smooth waves line up together so well that the combined wave - the wave you

hear when the two are played at the same time - is also a smooth wave. Tunings that

are slightly off from the pure interval, however, will result in a combined wave that has

a bumpiness in it. Because the two waves are each very even, the bump itself is very

even and regular, and can be heard as a "beat" - a very regular change in the intensity

of the sound. The beats are so regular, in fact, that they can be timed; for equal

temperament they are on the order of a beat per second in the mid range of a piano.

A piano tuner works by listening to and timing these beats, rather than by being able

to "hear" equal temperament intervals precisely.

It should also be noted that some music traditions around the world do not use the

type of precision tunings described above, not because they can't, but because of an

type of precision tunings described above, not because they can't, but because of an

aesthetic preference for wide tuning. In these traditions, the sound of many people

playing precisely the same pitch is considered a thin, uninteresting sound; the sound

of many people playing near the same pitch is heard as full, lively, and more

interesting.

Some music traditions even use an extremely precise version of wide tuning. The

gamelan orchestras of southeast Asia, for example, have an aesthetic preference for

the "lively and full" sounds that come from instruments playing near, not on, the same

pitch. In some types of gamelans, pairs of instruments are tuned very precisely so that

each pair produces beats, and the rate of the beats is the same throughout the entire

range of that gamelan. This impressive feat of tuning can only be reliably produced by

a few instrument makers with long-standing traditions.

In many music traditions, including Western music, the list of all the notes that are

expected or allowed in a particular piece of music is a scale. A long tradition of using

scales in particular ways has trained listeners to expect certain things from a piece of

music. If you hear a song in C major, for example, not only will your ear/brain expect

to hear the notes from the C major scale, it will expect to hear them grouped into

certain chords (Chords), and it will expect the chords to follow each other in certain

patterns (chord progressions (Chords)) and to end in a certain way (a cadence). You

don't have to have any musical training at all to have these expectations; you only

need to have grown up in a culture that listens to this kind of music.

The expectations for music in a minor key are a little different than for music in a

major key. But it is important to notice that you can move that song in C major to E

major key. But it is important to notice that you can move that song in C major to E

major, G flat major, or any other major key. It will sound basically the same, except

that it will sound higher or lower. In the same way, all minor keys are so alike that

music can easily be transposed from one minor key to another. (For more on this

subject, see Major Scales, Minor Scales, Scales that aren't Major or Minor, and

This sameness is not true for musical traditions that use modes instead of scales. In

these traditions, the mode, like a scale, lists the notes that are used in a piece of

music. But each mode comes with a different set of expectations in how those notes

will be used and arranged.

The above Figure 6.7 shows two scales and two modes. The two major scales use

different notes, but the relationship of the notes to each other is very similar. For

example, the pattern of half steps and whole steps in each one is the same, and the

interval (distance) between the tonic and the dominant is the same. Compare this to

the two church modes. The pattern of whole steps and half steps within the octave is

different; this would have a major effect on a chant, which would generally stay within

the one octave range. Also, the interval between the finalis and the dominant is

different, and they are in different places within the Range (Page 76) of the mode. The

result is that music in one mode would sound quite different than music in the other

mode. You can't simply Transposition: Changing Keys (Page 218) music from one

We can only guess what music from ancient Greek and Roman times really sounded

like. They didn't leave any recordings, of course, nor did they write down their music.

But they did write about music, so we know that they used modes based on

tetrachords. A tetrachord is a mini-scale of four notes, in Pitch: Sharp, Flat, and

Natural Notes (Page 11) order, that are contained within a Perfect Intervals (Page 127)

(five half steps) instead of an octave (twelve half steps).

Figure 6.8 Tetrachords Here are three possible Greek tetrachords, as nearly as they can be written in

modern notation. The outer notes are a perfect fourth apart; we can be pretty certain of that, since the

perfect fourth is a natural interval playable, for example, on many ancient wind instruments (See Harmonic

Series II and Interval). The actual tuning of the inner notes can only be guessed, however, since our equal

temperament is a relatively modern invention.

Since a tetrachord fills the interval of a perfect fourth, two tetrachords with a whole

step between the end of one and the beginning of the other will fill an octave.

Different Greek modes were built from different combinations of tetrachords.

We have very detailed descriptions of tetrachords and of Greek music theory (for

example, Har- monics, written by Aristoxenus in the fourth century B.C.), but there is

still no way of knowing exactly what the music really sounded like. The enharmonic,

chromatic, and diatonic tetrachords mentioned in ancient descriptions are often now

written as in the figure above. But references in the old texts to "shading" suggest that

the reality was more complex, and that they probably did not use the same intervals

we do. It is more likely that ancient Greek music sounded more like other traditional

Mediterranean and Middle Eastern musics than that it sounded anything like modern

Western music.

Westerncomposers often consistently choose minor keys over major keys (or vice

versa) to convey certain moods (minor for melancholy, for example, and major for

serene). One interesting aspect of Greek modes is that different modes were

considered to have very different effects, not only on a person's mood, but even on

character and morality. This may also be another clue that ancient modes may have

had more variety of tuning and pitch than modern keys do.

was also modal, and the medieval Church modes were also considered to have

different effects on the listener. (As of this writing the site Ricercares by Vincenzo

Galilei22 had a list of the "ethos" or mood associated with each medieval mode.) In

fact, the names of the church modes were borrowed from the Greek modes, but the

two systems don't really correspond to each other, or use the same name to indicate

the same set of intervals. So some books prefer to name the church modes using a

Roman numeral system. Each of these modes can easily be found by playing its one

octave range, or ambitus, on the "white key" notes on a piano. But the Dorian mode,

for example, didn't have to start on the pitch we call a D. The important thing was the

pattern of half steps and whole steps within that octave, and their relationship to the

notes that acted as the modal equivalent of tonal centers, the finalis and the

notes that acted as the modal equivalent of tonal centers, the finalis and the

dominant. Generally, the last note of the piece was the finalis, giving it the same

"resting place" function as a modern tonal center. The dominant, also called the

reciting tone or tenor, was the note most often used for long recitations on the same

pitch.

Figure 6.10 Church Modes The modes came in pairs which shared the same finalis.

A mode can be found by playing all the "white key" notes on a piano for one octave.

From D to D, for example is Dorian; from F to F is Lydian. Notice that no modes begin

on A, B, or C. This is because a B flat was allowed, and the modes beginning on D, E,

and F, when they use a B flat, have the same note patterns and relationships as would

modes beginning on A, B, and C. After the middle ages, modes beginning on A, B, and

C were named, but they are still not considered Church modes. Notice that the Aeolian

(or the Dorian using a B flat) is the same as an A (or D) natural minor (pg 131) scale

and the Ionian (or the Lydian using a B flat) is the same as a C (or F) major scale.

Figure 6.11 Theoretical Modes These modes are part of the same theoretical system as the church modes,

but they were not used.

In our modern tonal system, any note may be sharp, flat, or natural, but in this modal

system, only the B was allowed to vary. The symbols used to indicate whether the B

was "hard" (our B natural) or "soft" (our B flat) eventually evolved into our symbols for

sharps, flats, and naturals. All of this may seem very arbitrary, but it's important to

remember that medieval mode theory, just like our modern music theory, was not

trying to invent a logical system of music. It was trying to explain, describe, and

systematize musical practices that were already flourishing because people liked the

way they sounded.

evolved from medieval notation indicating what type of B should be used.

The Tuning (Page 194) used in medieval Europe was also not our familiar Equal

Temperament (Page 204) system. It was a just intonation system, based on a pure

perfect fifth. In this system, half steps are not all equal to each other. Slight

adjustments are made in tuning and intervals to make them more pleasant to the ear;

and the medieval ear had different preferences than our modern ears. This is another

reason that modes sounded very different from each other, although that particular

Some jazz and folk music is also considered modal and also uses the Greek/medieval

mode names. In this case, the scales used are the same as the medieval church

modes, but they do not have a reciting tone and are used much more like modern

major and minor scales. Modal European (and American) folk music tends to be older

tunes that have been around for hundreds of years. Modal jazz, on the other hand, is

fairly new, having developed around 1960.

It is important to remember when discussing these types of music that it does not

matter what specific note the modal scale starts on. What matters is the pattern of

notes within the scale, and the relationship of the pattern to the tonic/finalis. For

example, note that the Dorian "scale" as written above starts on a D but basically has a

C major key signature, resulting in the third and seventh notes of the scale being a half

step lower than in a D major scale. (A jazz musician would call this flatted or flat

thirds and sevenths.) So any scale with a flatted third and seventh can be called a

Dorian scale.

1. D major has 2 sharps: F sharp and C sharp.

2. Looking at Figure 6.10, you can see that the Lydian mode starts on an F. The key

of F major would have a B flat, but in the mode this is raised one half step, to B

natural. Therefore the fourth degree of the Lydian mode is raised one half step.

3. F lydian has the same key signature as C major, which is a perfect fourth lower. So

all Lydian modes have the same key signature as the major key a perfect fourth

below them.

The ragas of classical India and other, similar traditions, are more like modes than

they are like scales. Like modes, different ragas sound very different from each other,

for several reasons. They may have different interval patterns between the "scale"

notes, have different expectations for how each note of the raga is to be used, and

may even use slightly different tunings. Like the modal musics discussed above,

individual Indian ragas are associated with specific moods.

In fact, in practice, ragas are even more different from each other than the medieval

European modes were. The raga dictates how each note should be used, more

Specifically than a modal or major-minor system does. Some pitches will get more

emphasis than others; some will be used one way in an ascending melody and

another way in a descending melody; some will be used in certain types of ornaments.

And these rules differ from one raga to the next. The result is that each raga is a

And these rules differ from one raga to the next. The result is that each raga is a

collection of melodic scales, phrases, motifs, and ornaments, that may be used

together to construct music in that raga. The number of possible ragas is practically

limitless, and there are hundreds in common use. A good performer will be familiar

with dozens of ragas and can improvise music - traditional classical music in India is

improvised - using the accepted format for each raga.

The raga even affects the tuning of the notes. Indian classical music is usually

accompanied by a tanpura, which plays a drone background. The tanpura is usually

tuned to a pure perfect fifth, so, just as in medieval European music, the tuning

system is a just intonation system. As in Western just intonation, the octave is divided

into twelve possible notes, only some of which are used in a particular raga (just as

Westerners use only some of the twelve notes in each key). But as was true for the

Westerners use only some of the twelve notes in each key). But as was true for the

church modes, using the pure perfect fifth means that some "half steps" will be larger

than others. (If you would like to understand why this is so, please see Harmonic

Series II and Tuning Systems.) Even though the variations between these different

"half steps" are small, they strongly affect the sound of the music. So, the tuning of

some of the notes (not the ones dictated by the tanpura) may be adjusted to better

suit a particular raga. (Please see Listening to Indian Classical Music and Indian

Classical Music: Tuning and Ragas for more information on this subject.)

are the two most familiar traditions that are not based on major and minor scales. But

many other musical traditions around the world are not based on Western scales.

Some of these have modes similar to the medieval Church modes; they also tend to

be a list of notes (or a pattern of intervals) used with a specific finalis, which may

encourage certain types of melodies. While the church mode/jazz mode tradition

features diatonic modes (which can be played using only the white keys of a piano),

non-Western modes may use other types of scales.

In other music traditions, modes are much more like Indian ragas, featuring important

variations in tuning and melodic expectations from one mode to the next, so that each

mode may be seen as a collection of related melodic ideas, phrases, and

ornamentations that are traditionally played with a certain set of notes tuned in a

certain way. (Some non-Indian traditions even use the term raga.)

certain way. (Some non-Indian traditions even use the term raga.)

All of these musics have long traditions that are very different from the familiar major-

minor tonal system, and usually also have a different approach to harmony, rhythm, and performance practice.

Changing the key of a piece of music is called transposing the music. Music in a major

key can be transposed to any other major key; music in a minor key can be

transposed to any other minor key. (Changing a piece from minor to major or vice-

versa requires many more changes than simple transposition.) A piece will also sound

higher or lower once it is transposed. There are some ways to avoid having to do the

transposition yourself, but learning to transpose can be very useful for performers,

composers, and arrangers.

To put it in the right key for your vocalists. If your singer or singers are struggling

with notes that are too high or low, changing the key to put the music in their

Range (Page 76) will result in a much better performance.



Instrumentalists may also find that a piece is easier to play if it is in a different key.

Players of both bowed and plucked strings generally find fingerings and tuning to

be easier in sharp keys, while woodwind and brass players often find flat keys

more comfortable and in tune.

In some situations, you can avoid transposition, or at least avoid doing the work

yourself. Some stringed instruments - guitar for example - can use a capo to play in

higher keys. A good electronic keyboard will transpose for you. If your music is already

stored as a computer file, there are programs that will transpose it for you and display

and print it in the new key. However, if you only have the music on paper, it may be

easier to transpose it yourself than to enter it into a music program to have it

transposed. So if none of these situations apply to you, it's time to learn to transpose.

Note: If you play a chordal instrument (guitar, for example), you may not need

to write down the transposed music. There are instructions below for

transposing just the names of the chords.

1. Choose your transposition.

2. Use the correct key signature.

3. Move all the notes the correct interval.

4. Take care with your accidentals.

If you have chosen the transposition because you want a particular key, then you

should already know what key signature to use. (If you don't, see Key Signature.) If you

have chosen the transposition because you wanted a particular interval (say, a whole

step lower or a perfect fifth higher), then the key changes by the same interval. For

Transposing a piece in B minor down a major third (Major and Minor Intervals) will

move the key signature down a major third to G minor. For more information on and

practice identifying intervals, see Interval. For further information on how moving

music up or down changes the key signature, see The Circle of Fifths.

Figure 6.15 Move all the Notes Did you move the key down a minor third? Simply move all the notes down

a third in the new key; count down three lines-or-spaces to find the new spot for each note. Did you move

the key up a perfect fourth? Then move all the notes up four lines-and-spaces. Remember to count every

line and every space, including the ones the notes start on and end on. Once you get the hang of it, this step

is very straightforward, but it may take a while if you have a lot of music.

Most notes can simply be moved the correct number of lines and spaces. Whether the

interval is minor, major, or perfect will take care of itself if the correct key signature

has been chosen. But some care must be taken to correctly transpose accidentals. Put

the note on the line or space where it would fall if it were not an accidental, and then

either lower or raise it from your new key signature. For example, an accidental B

natural in the key of E flat major has been raised a half step from the note in the key

(which is B flat). In transposing down to the key of D major, you need to raise the A

natural in the key up a half step, to A sharp. If this is confusing, keep in mind that the

interval between the old and new (transposed) notes (B natural and A sharp) must be

one half step, just as it is for the notes in the key.

Note: If you need to raise a note which is already sharp in the key, or lower a

note that is already flat, use double sharps or double flats (Figure 1.17)

If you are trying to accomodate singers, your main concern in choosing a key is finding

their range. Is the music you are working with too high or too low? Is it only a step too

high, or does it need to be changed by a third or a fifth? Once you determine the

interval needed, check to make certain this will be a comfortable key for your

instrumentalists.

An alto vocalist would like to perform a blues standard originally

sung by a soprano or tenor in B flat. She needs the song to be at least

a whole step lower. Lowering it by a whole step would put it in the

key of A flat. The guitar, bass, and harmonica players don't like to

play in A flat, however, and the vocalist wouldn't mind singing even

lower. So the best solution is to lower it by a minor third (Major and

Minor Intervals), and play in the key of G.

Transposing instruments are instruments for which standard parts are written

higher or lower than they sound. A very accomplished player of one of these

instruments may be able to transpose at sight, saving you the trouble of writing out a

transposed part, but most players of these instruments will need a transposed part

written out for them. Here is a short list of the most common transposing

instruments. For a more complete list and more information, see Transposing

Instruments.

Clarinet is usually (but not always) a B flat instrument. Transpose C parts up one

whole step for B flat instruments. (In other words, write a B flat part one whole

step higher than you want it to sound.)

Trumpet and Cornet parts can be found in both B flat and C, but players with B

flat instruments will probably want a B flat (transposed) part.

French Horn parts are usually in F these days. However, because of the

instrument's history, older orchestral parts may be in any conceivable

transposition, even changing transpositions in the middle of the piece. Because of

this, some horn players learn to transpose at sight. Transpose C parts up a

perfect fifth to be read in F.

Alto and Baritone Saxophone are E flat instruments. Transpose parts up a major

sixth for alto sax, and up an octave plus a major sixth for bari sax.

Note: Why are there transposing instruments? Sometimes this makes things easier on

instrumentalists; they may not have to learn different fingerings when they switch

from one kind of saxophone to another, for example. Sometimes, as with piccolo,

transposition centers the music in the staff (rather than above or below the staff). But

often transposing instruments are a result of the history of the instrument. See the

history of the French horn40 to find out more.

The transposition you will use for one of these instruments will depend on what type

of part you have in hand, and what instrument you would like to play that part. As with

any instrumental part, be aware of the range of the instrument that you are writing

for. If transposing the part up a perfect fifth results in a part that is too high to be

comfortable, consider transposing the part down a perfect fourth instead.

To Decide Transpositions for Transposing Instruments

1. Ask: what type of part am I transposing and what type of part do I want? Do you

have a C part and want to turn it into an F part? Do you want to turn a B flat part

into a C part? Non-transposing parts are considered to be C parts. The written key

signature has nothing to do with the type of part you have; only the part's

transposition from concert pitch (C part) matters for this step.

2. Find the interval between the two types of part. For example, the difference

between a C and a B flat part is one whole step. The difference between an E flat

part and a B flat part is a perfect fifth.

3. Make sure you are transposing in the correct direction. If you have a C part and

want it to become a B flat part, for example, you must transpose up one whole

step. This may seem counterintuitive, but remember, you are basically

compensating for the transposition that is "built into" the instrument. To compensate

properly, always transpose by moving in the opposite direction from the change

in the part names. To turn a B flat part into a C part (B flat to C = up one step),

transpose the part down one whole step. To turn a B flat part into an E flat part (B

flat to E flat = down a perfect fifth), transpose the part up a perfect fifth.

Your garage band would like to feature a solo by a friend who plays

the alto youâre your songwriter has written the solo as it sounds on

his keyboard, so you have a C art. Alto sax is an E flat instrument; in

other words, when he sees a C, he plays an E flat, the note a major

sixth (Major and Minor Intervals) lower. To compensate for this, you

must write the part a major sixth higher than your C part.

line it has been transposed to be read by an alto saxophone. When the second line is

Transposition can also make music easier to play for instrumentalists, and ease of

playing generally translates into more satisfying performances. For example,

transcriptions for band of orchestral works sometimes change the (often sharp)

orchestral key to a nearby key with more flats. A guitar player, given a piece written in

A flat for keyboard, will often prefer to play it in A or G, since the fingerings for chords

in those keys are easier. Also, instrumentalists, like vocalists, have ranges that need to

be considered.

those thin-sounding chords in A flat. You can use your capo to raise the sound of your

instrument (basically turning it into a transposing instrument in C sharp, D, D sharp, or

even higher), but the less you raise it the more likely you are to still sound in tune with

the piano.

Transposing at sight means being able to read a part written in one key while playing

it in another key. Like any other performance skill, it can be learned with practice, and

it is a skill that will help you become an extremely versatile instrumentalist. (Vocalists

transpose at sight without even thinking about it, since they don't have to worry about

different fingerings.) To practice this skill, simply start playing familiar pieces in a

different key. Since you know the piece, you will recognize when you make a mistake.

Start with pieces written in C, and play them only a half-step or whole step lower or

higher than written. When this is easy, move on to more challenging keys and larger

intervals. Practice playing in an unfamiliar clef, for example bass clef if you are used to

reading treble clef. Or, if you play a transposing instrument, work on being able to play

C parts on sight. You may find more opportunities to play (and earn the gratitude of

If you are transposing entire chords, and you know the name of the chord, you may

find it easier to simply transpose the name of the chord rather than transposing each

individual note. In fact, transposing in this way is simple enough that even a musician

who can't read music can do it.

Figure 6.25 Chromatic Circle When transposing, you can use the chromatic circle both to change the name

of the key (as above (Find the New Key)) and to change chord names, because the basic idea is the same;

the entire piece (chords, notes, and key) must move the same number of half steps in the same direction. If

you're using a chromatic circle to transpose the names of all the chords in a piece, just make sure that you

move each chord name by the same amount and in the same direction.

Your choice of new key will depend on why you are transposing, but it may depend on

other things, also.

If you are transposing because the music is too low or too high, decide how much

higher or lower you want the music to sound. If you want the music to sound

higher, go around the chromatic circle (Figure 6.25) in the clockwise direction. If

you want it lower, go in the counterclockwise direction. The further you go, the

more it will change. Notice that, since you're going in a circle, raising the music a

lot eventually gives the same chords as lowering it a little (and vice-versa). If some

keys are easier for you to play in than others, you may want to check to make sure the key you choose has "nice" chords. If not, try another key near it.



If you are changing keys in order to make the chords easy to play, try changing the

final chord so that it names an easy-to-play-in key. (Guitarists, for example, often

find the keys G, D, A, E, C, Am, Em, and Dm easier to play in than other keys.) The

last chord of most pieces will usually be the chord that names the key. If that

last chord of most pieces will usually be the chord that names the key. If that

doesn't seem to work for your piece, try a transposition that makes the most

common chord an easy chord. Start changing the other chords by the same

amount, and in the same direction, and see if you are getting mostly easyto- play

chords. While deciding on a new key, though, keep in mind that you are also

making the piece higher or lower, and choose keys accordingly. A guitarist who

wants to change chords without changing the pitch should lower the key (go

counterclockwise on the circle) by as short a distance as possible to find a

If you are changing keys to play with another instrumentalist who is transposing or

who is playing in a different key from you, you will need to figure out the correct

transposition. For a transposing instrument, look up the correct transposition (the

person playing the instrument may be able to tell you), and move all of your

chords up or down by the correct number of half steps. (For example, someone

playing a B flat trumpet will read parts one step - two half steps - lower than

concert pitch. So to play from the same part as the trumpet player, move all the

chords counterclockwise two places.) If the instrumental part is simply written in

a different key, find out what key it is in (the person playing it should be able to

tell you, based on the key signature) and what key you are playing in (you may

have to make a guess based on the final chord of the piece or the most common

chord). Use the chromatic circle to find the direction and number of half steps to

and in the same direction. Change only the note names (things like "F" and "C sharp"

and "B flat"); don't change any other information about the chord (like major, minor,

dim., 7, sus4, add11, etc.). If the bass note of the chord is written out as a note name,

change that, also (using the same chromatic circle).

Check your transposition by playing it to see if it sounds right. If you don't like playing

some of the chords in your new key, or if you have changed the key too much or not

enough, try a different transposition.

Say you have a song in the key of G, which is too low for your voice. If

it's just a little too low, you can go up two keys to A. If this is still too

low, you can go up even further (5 keys altogether) to the key of C.

Maybe that's high enough for your voice, but you no longer like the

chords. If that is the case, you can go up two more keys to D. Notice

that, because the keys are arranged in a circle, going up seven keys

like this is the same as going down five keys.

Now say you have a song in the key of E flat. It's not hard to sing in

that key, so you don't want to go far, but you really don't like playing

in E flat. You can move the song up one key to E, but you might like

the chords even better if you move them down one key to D.

Notice that if you are a guitar player, and everyone else really wants

to stay in E flat, you can write the chords out in D and play them with

a capo on the first fret; to everyone else it will sound as if you're

playing in E flat.
