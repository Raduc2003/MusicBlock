The authors of this chapter have noticed a loss of reverberation detail when substituting some synthetic cones for paper cones used up to 1 kHz, and have received comments from professional users about guitar strings not sounding as new when heard via the synthetic cones as when heard via high quality paper pulp cones. The Celestion loudspeakers company still produce the exact model of guitar loudspeaker which was made famous in the Vox AC30 guitar amplifier of the 1960s. This blue-chassised driver has resisted all efforts to update its construction, yet still maintain its highly desirable sound qualities. A great number of musicians claim to hear their guitars more “clearly” via paper cones.\n---\nKB: production/Douglas_Self_Audio_Engineering_Explained.pdf (Pg:528):\nWe will discuss the matter of timbre changes later, and we will see that tone coloration can be either positive or negative, depending on how one asks the question in an experiment. Again, we will go back to the quote in the caption that with the addition of a reflection, “the music [begins] to gain body and fullness,” which can readily be interpreted to be tonal coloration but of a possibly desirable form.\n\nThreshold curve shapes for different sounds It is useful to go back now and compare the shapes of the threshold contours determined by Barron for music with those shown earlier for speech, both in anechoic listening conditions. Figure 19.14 shows such a comparison, and it is seen that curves obtained using the anechoically recorded Mozart excerpt are much flatter than those for speech.\n---\nKB: production/Douglas_Self_Audio_Engineering_Explained.pdf (Pg:352):\nTherefore, whilst technical accuracy in terms of conventional reproduction might be compromised, the developers of such combined systems can reasonably claim that the perceptual fidelity, in terms of overall realism, may be superior, at least on certain types of music, to reproduction on systems with more measurable fidelity in the conventional sense. Whilst it would seem to be unwise to use the com- bined systems for music recording quality monitoring, the beneficial effects of Layered Sound for elec- tric piano amplification seems to be established. Of course, if recordings were being specially made for reproduction on these composite systems or their derivatives, then the monitoring of the recordings via such systems may also be justified. Development of DMLs is still in progress, however, and some new designs are already emerging with much less colored responses than have previously been achievable.\n\nSE INFO:\nNo SE info.\n---\n\nPlease generate 2-4 distinct and actionable production or mixing suggestions for this music project.\nFocus ONLY on aspects like arrangement polish, mixing techniques (EQ, compression, stereo imaging), choice and use of effects (reverb, delay, modulation), or overall sonic character.\nIf the retrieved knowledge chunks are sparse or not directly relevant, rely more on the project goal to generate general but applicable ideas.\nEnsure your suggestions are formatted as Markdown bullet points.

The desired mood is one of soulfulness and emotional intensity, with a focus on storytelling through lyrics. Instrumentation may include electric guitar, harmonica, piano, and drums, with a emphasis on creating a raw, live sound. A moderate tempo of around 100-110 BPM is expected, with a key signature likely to be in E or A minor.

Audio recordings are (cid:28)ne, but if the drone is produced by an unfamiliar instrument, video recordings are even better. Bagpipe music or classical music from India will probably be the easi- est examples to (cid:28)nd, but some more uncommon instruments from various music traditions, like the Appalachian dulcimer (not the hammered dulcimer) may also have drones.\n\nDecide on a song to teach your students that has a drone part in the voice or on instruments.

Amount of time necessary depends on student facility in composition and improvisation, and on number of student or group performances.\n\nObjectives - The student will compose, manipulate and use motifs in composition an/or improvisation. • Evaluation - For assessment, look at melodic and rhythmic quality of motif, ability to manipulate the motif in more than one way, and successful use of the motif in the composition or improvisation.\n---\nKB: rythm/TBQ_the_basic_elements_of_music.pdf (Pg:32):\n2. Have the students listen to excerpts of instrumental music. Encourage them to come up with adjectives that describe the color of the instruments. Some words that musicians often use to describe color/timbre are: bright, dark, full, thin, warm, rich, reedy, rounded, edgy, breathy (pronounced BRETH-ee), scratchy, heavy, light, transparent, and intense. If your students have trouble coming up with adjectives, suggest some of these, but encourage them to come up with their own, too. If students independently come up with a timbre word that musicians often use, point this out and congratulate them on doing so; but point out that the use of timbre words is fairly informal, and coming up with their own is (cid:28)ne, too, particularly if they are good descriptions of the sound. eCopy available for free at Textbook Equity http://textbookequity.org/the-basic-elements-of-music or http://cnx.org/content/ col10218/1.8\n\nSE INFO:\nNo SE info.\n---\n\nPlease generate 2-4 distinct and actionable rhythm suggestions for this music project.\nFocus ONLY on aspects like drum patterns, percussion, rhythmic feel, groove techniques, beat programming, and tempo considerations.\nIf the retrieved knowledge chunks are sparse or not directly relevant, rely more on the project goal to generate general but applicable rhythmic ideas.\nEnsure your suggestions are formatted as Markdown bullet points.

If you\'re not familiar with modes you might want to explore that. But put simply, both have the same notes they just start on different notes. For example, A natural minor (A B C D E F G) is just the aeolian mode of C major (C D E F G A B).\n=====\nQ:Confusion about blues scale and chords\nA:As for your initial assumption, that "when playing a song in a certain scale, usually all chords will only contain notes in that scale": that\'s actually untrue! See\nDoes playing in scale mean only using notes from that scale?\nYou can (and eventually will) have pitches outside the scale, but often these are best done following particular stipulations that we can\'t outline in a single answer.\nAs for the blues scale and chords, they\'re just two different animals.\nThe twelve-bar blues in C is based on chords built on C, F, and G. Sometimes there are extensions, and sometimes there are other chords inserted, but that\'s the basic twelve-bar blues. These chords are used\nto create the harmonic background of the blues\n.\nMeanwhile, the C blues scale, which you accurately described,\nis typically used to solo, not to create the harmonic background\n. In other words, the pitches of the blues scale\ncan often fit on top of the twelve-bar blues, even if they aren\'t always a part of the twelve-bar blues progression\n. (But note that you can use other scales/concepts to solo, not just this one.)\nIt\'s a bit like baking a cake, maybe.
