Although the tone is generally aimed at musicians and people with lit- tle prior knowledge of music systems, there may be some mathematical concepts and programming techniques that are not familiar.

The book focuses on synthesis from a digital perspective rather than an analogue one, since it aims to demonstrate the theory of digital synthesis rather than applications to a specific medium or piece of software.

Use diagrams and pictures where possible to illustrate ideas; it informs and makes the Wikibook more readable, approachable and better overall. • Key terms and words are included in a /Glossary/ for further clarification.

Important statements or facts should be highlighted in the following way.

Content: informational asides where appropriate.

One of the underlying goals of this book is to demonstrate the extraordinary connectedness of analysis and actual

musical experience. To accomplish this, we have included hundreds examples from actual compositions to

demonstrate—and in some cases problematize—the ideas discussed herein. An individual’s facility with analyzing

different types of music will affect both their experience as a listener and their sensitivity as a performer. Likewise, one’s

development as a performer will be a tremendous aid in their ability to analyze music quickly and in a manner that is

consistent with actual experience. It is far too easy to lose track of the audible when studying music theory, focusing

only on memorizing lists of conventions and the accompanying terminology. To forge an active connection between

analysis, performance, and listening, then, the reader is encouraged to pay close attention to every musical example

Content: 9.5 Summary

Minor scales are created by the following ascending pattern of intervals from the tonic: W-H-W-W-H-W-W. They can

also be created by lowering scale degrees , and of a major scale by one semitone each.

As with major keys, minor keys are based on the pitches of the corresponding scale and are indicated by key signatures

at the beginning of each new line of music. Minor key signatures are derived from the diatonic version of the minor

scale. Minor key signatures look just like major key signatures and follow the same pattern and placement on the staff.

Minor keys can be closely related to major keys in several different ways. Parallel keys—C major and C minor, for example—share the same tonic. Relative keys—C minor and E major, for example—have different tonics but share the same key signature. Every key signature, then, can be used to represent two different (relative) keys.

Content: The Psychology of Counterpoint

The chapters on species counterpoint will not involve a specific style (classical, baroque, romantic, pop/

rock, etc.). Instead, these exercises will set aside important musical elements like orchestration, melodic

motives, formal structure, and even many elements of harmony and rhythm, in order to focus very

specifically on a small set of fundamental musical problems. These fundamental problems are closely

related to how some basic principles of auditory perception and cognition (i.e., how the brain perceives

and conceptualizes sound) play out in Western musical structure.

For example, our brains tend to assume that sounds similar in pitch or timbre come from the same source.

Our brains also listen for patterns, and when a new sound continues or completes a previously heard

pattern, we typically assume that the new sound belongs together with those others. This is related to

Threshold curve shapes for different sounds It is useful to go back now and compare the shapes of the threshold contours determined by Barron for music with those shown earlier for speech, both in anechoic listening conditions. Figure 19.14 shows such a comparison, and it is seen that curves obtained using the anechoically recorded Mozart excerpt are much flatter than those for speech.

Content: As a performance-based control language, MIDI complements modern music production, by allow- ing a performance track to be edited, layered, altered, spindled, mutilated, and improved with relative ease under completely automated computer control and after the fact, during post-production. If you played a bad note, fix it. If you want to change the key or tempo of a piece, change it. If you want to change the expressive volume of a phrase in a song, just do it! Even its sonic character (timbre) can be changed! These capabilities merely hint at the power of this medium that widely affects the project studio, professional studio, audio or visual and film, live performance, multimedia, and even your cell phone!

Content: In addition to recording a performance in a track-based environment, most sequencers let you enter note values into sequence one note at a time. This feature (known as step time) lets you give the sequencer a basic tempo and note length (i.e., quarter note, sixteenth note, etc.) and then manually enter the notes from a keyboard or other controller. This data entry style is often (but not always) used with fast, hi-tech and dance styles, where a real-time performance just isn’t possible or accurate enough for the song.

Whether you’re recording a track in real-time or in step-time, it’s almost always best to select the proper song tempo before recording a sequence. I bring this up because most sequencers are able to output a click track that can be used as an accurate audible guide for keeping in time with the song’s selected tempo. It’s also critical that the tempo be accurate when trying to sync groove loops and rhythms to a sequence via plug-ins or external instruments.

Content: CHAPTER 2. PITCH ELEMENTS

The (cid:28)ve-note "alien message" motif in John Williams’ score for "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" may already be familiar to some students. Many other movie and television scores also include short motifs (see below (Section 2.2.5.2: Melodic Themes and Movies)).

Not all motivic music is classical in style; from early ragtime tunes like Joplin’s "Maple Leaf Rag", through big band tunes like "String of Pearls" and "In the Mood", to the cool jazz of Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue, to the latest improvised solo, jazz is full of motifs.

Listen for the two-note "look down" motive from the work song at the beginning of Les Miserables to return throughout the musical. There are other motives in this musical, too, and in many other musicals (Phantom of the Opera, for example).

Rhythm Section - The rhythm section of a band is the group of instruments that usually provide the background rhythm and chords. The rhythm section almost always includes a percussionist (usually on a drum set) and a bass player (usually playing a plucked string bass of some kind). It may also include a piano and/or other keyboard players, more percussionists, and one or more guitar players or other strummed or plucked strings. Vocalists, wind instruments, and bowed strings are usually not part of the rhythm section.

Syncopation - Syncopation occurs when a strong note happens either on a weak beat or o(cid:27) the beat. See Syncopation7.

* **Harp Guitar with Dissonant Harmonics**: Use a harp guitar to create a unique, melancholic sound. Experiment with playing dissonant harmonics to create a sense of tension and unease. This can be achieved by playing the strings at odd harmonics (e.g., 3rd, 5th, or 7th harmonics) or using a harmonizer pedal to create dissonant intervals. Combine the harp guitar with a piano or acoustic guitar to create a sense of depth and complexity.
* **Digital Waveguide Synthesized Cello**: Use a digital waveguide synthesizer to create a haunting, ethereal cello sound. Experiment with different waveforms and filter settings to create a sense of vibrato and expression. This can be particularly effective in creating a sense of longing and melancholy. Consider layering the synthesized cello with a real acoustic cello or a violin to add depth and texture.

* **Create space with stereo imaging**: To emphasize the emotional intimacy of the song, focus on creating a sense of space between the instruments and vocals. Use stereo imaging techniques such as panning and depth effects to create a sense of distance between the instruments. For example, panning the acoustic guitar to one side and the piano to the other can create a sense of width and depth.
* **Use EQ to enhance the melancholy atmosphere**: Use EQ to enhance the low-end frequencies of the acoustic guitar and piano, which can create a sense of weight and sorrow. Cut frequencies around 200-300 Hz to remove any unwanted muddiness and allow the lower frequencies to shine through. This will help to create a sense of melancholy and introspection.
* **Add depth with reverb and room simulations**: To create a sense of space and atmosphere, use reverb and room simulations to enhance the ambiance of the instruments and vocals. Use a combination of plate reverb and room simulations to create a sense of distance and decay. This will help to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability.
* **Use compression to control dynamics**: Use compression to control the dynamics of the instruments and vocals, which can help to create a sense of emotional intensity. Use a compressor with a ratio of 4:1 to 8:1 to control the peak levels of the instruments, and use a slow attack and release time to create a sense of sustain and decay. This will help to create a sense of emotional depth and introspection.

Use a slow, legato playing style to create a sense of introspection. The arpeggio pattern should follow a pattern of strong-weak-weak-weak-strong-weak, emphasizing the first beat of each measure. This will create a sense of forward motion while maintaining a contemplative atmosphere.
* **Half-Time Rhythm with Percussive Accents**: Experiment with a half-time rhythm (around 105 BPM) to create a sense of longing and melancholy. Use a combination of quarter notes and eighth notes, with a strong emphasis on the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4. Add percussive accents on the snare drum on beats 1 and 3, and on the hi-hat on the "and"s of beat 2 and beat 4. This will create a sense of tension and release, adding emotional depth to the song.
* **Slow, Shuffling Groove**: Create a slow, shuffling groove that evokes a sense of vulnerability and sadness. Use a combination of quarter notes and eighth notes on the kick drum, with a slow, dragging feel. Emphasize the "and" of beat 2 and the "and" of beat 4 with the snare drum, and add subtle hi-hat accents to create a sense of forward motion.

Here are 4 actionable music theory suggestions for your "very sad guitar ballad" project:

* **Use the C Minor Natural Minor Scale**: The C minor natural minor scale (C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C) can create a somber and introspective atmosphere, fitting for a melancholic ballad. This scale has a natural minor sound that can evoke feelings of sadness and longing.
* **Experiment with Parallel Keys in the Key of C Minor**: Since C minor is a parallel key to C major, you can use this relationship to create a sense of tension and release. For example, you could use the I-V-vi-IV progression (Cm - G7 - Am - F) in a C minor key, and then shift to a C major key for the chorus or bridge. This can create a sense of emotional intensity and contrast.
* **Use the E Minor Lydian Mode as a Melodic Idea**: The E minor Lydian mode (E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E) has a distinctive, melancholic sound that can add to the emotional intensity of your ballad. You can use this mode as a melodic idea for your vocal or instrumental lines, or as a harmonic basis for your chord progressions.
* **Employ the 6/8 Time Signature and a Slow, Contemplative Chord Progression**: The 6/8 time signature can create a sense of introspection and contemplation, fitting for a melancholic ballad. You can use a slow, contemplative chord progression like Cm - G7 - Am - F in a 6/8 time signature, and then repeat it with slight variations to create a sense of emotional intensity and vulnerability.

* **Create space with stereo imaging**: To emphasize the emotional intimacy of the song, focus on creating a sense of space between the instruments and vocals. Use stereo imaging techniques such as panning and depth effects to create a sense of distance between the instruments. For example, panning the acoustic guitar to one side and the piano to the other can create a sense of width and depth.
* **Use EQ to enhance the melancholy atmosphere**: Use EQ to enhance the low-end frequencies of the acoustic guitar and piano, which can create a sense of weight and sorrow. Cut frequencies around 200-300 Hz to remove any unwanted muddiness and allow the lower frequencies to shine through. This will help to create a sense of melancholy and introspection.
* **Add depth with reverb and room simulations**: To create a sense of space and atmosphere, use reverb and room simulations to enhance the ambiance of the instruments and vocals. Use a combination of plate reverb and room simulations to create a sense of distance and decay. This will help to create a sense of intimacy and vulnerability.
* **Use compression to control dynamics**: Use compression to control the dynamics of the instruments and vocals, which can help to create a sense of emotional intensity. Use a compressor with a ratio of 4:1 to 8:1 to control the peak levels of the instruments, and use a slow attack and release time to create a sense of sustain and decay. This will help to create a sense of emotional depth and introspection.
