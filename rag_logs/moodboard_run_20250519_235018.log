For example, play a snare drum on beats 1 and 3, a bass drum on beats 2 and 4, and a hi-hat on the off-beats. This will allow the listener to focus on each individual element and create a more intricate and layered rhythm section.\n* **Swing-Inspired Groove**: Create a groove with a strong emphasis on the 2nd and 4th beats, with a more subtle feel on the 1st and 3rd beats. This will give the track a sense of swing and feel, and create a sense of forward momentum. Use a combination of snare drums, bass drums, and hi-hats to create a driving rhythm that propels the track forward.\n* **Stutter Edit Technique**: Use the stutter edit technique to create a stuttering or "chopping" effect on the snare drum and hi-hats.

This can be achieved by applying a gentle low-pass filter (LPF) and a soft, subtle compression to the sample, followed by a brief reverb to give it a sense of space.\n* **Bassline and Kick Drum Balance**: To create a more driving and energetic vibe, focus on balancing the bassline and kick drum levels. Try applying a gentle boost to the bassline to give it more weight, and then use a soft, gentle compression to control the dynamics of the kick drum. This will help the kick drum sit better in the mix and create a more cohesive low-end sound.\n* **Stereo Imaging and Depth**: To create a more immersive and danceable vibe, experiment with stereo imaging techniques to create depth and width in the mix. Try using a stereo widener plugin to enhance the stereo image of the guitars and other instruments, and then use a subtle spatializer effect to create a sense of distance and space. This will help the instruments sit more naturally in the stereo field and create a more engaging listening experience.\n* **Vocal Processing and Clarity**: To enhance the clarity and punch of the vocals, try applying a gentle EQ boost to the high-end frequencies (above 5 kHz) to give the vocals a more open and airy sound. Additionally, use a soft, subtle compression to control the dynamics of the vocals and create a more even, consistent level.

## Project Goal
Based on the user's request for "very dancy house music with a guitar sampled to sound interesting" and the provided similarity analysis, here's a concise project goal summary:

Create a high-energy house music track that incorporates a prominently featured guitar sample, reminiscent of the dance-oriented styles of Daft Punk's "Get Lucky" or the grunge-influenced guitar riffs of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit". The track should maintain a fast-paced tempo, likely between 115-120 BPM, and feature a key signature that complements the guitar sample, such as F minor. The mood should be upbeat and energetic, evoking the feeling of a vibrant dance floor.

The instrumentation should include a prominent guitar sample, accompanied by a driving beat and synthesized elements, possibly incorporating elements of disco, funk, and electronic music. The track should have a modern, edgy sound, with a focus on creating a captivating and energetic listening experience.


## Rhythm & Groove
* **Disco-Funk Drums**: Create a driving beat using a combination of snappy snare, deep bass drum, and syncopated hi-hat patterns. Incorporate a "one-and" feel, where the kick drum hits on beats 1 and 3, and the snare hits on the "and" of beats 2 and 4. This will create a sense of tension and release, characteristic of disco and funk music. Use a tempo range of 115-120 BPM to maintain the fast-paced energy.

* **Grunge-Influenced Kick**: Experiment with a more aggressive kick drum pattern, emphasizing the "and" of beats 2 and 4. This will give the track a more driving, grunge-influenced feel. Use a slower kick velocity to create a sense of "pumping" energy, which is characteristic of grunge music. This will add a layer of complexity to the drum pattern and create a more dynamic feel.

* **Percussion Breakdown**: Break down the drum pattern into smaller sections, using different percussion elements to create a sense of rhythmic interest. For example, use the snare drum on beats 1 and 3, the bass drum on beats 2 and 4, and the hi-hat on the "and" of beats 2 and 4. Then, use the percussion elements (such as tambourines, shakers, or congas) to create a rhythmic breakdown, where the drums drop out and the percussion takes center stage. This will create a sense of tension and release, and add a layer of complexity to the track.

* **Groove- Oriented Hi-Hats**: Use the hi-hats to create a sense of rhythmic groove, rather than just playing them as a straightforward "one-and" pattern. Experiment with different hi-hat patterns, such as playing the top hat on the "and" of beats 2 and 4, and the bottom hat on the "one" of beats 1 and 3. This will create a more dynamic and interesting rhythmic feel, and add a layer of musicality to the track.

## Music Theory & Harmony
Here are 4 distinct and actionable music theory suggestions for your high-energy house music track:

* **Use the F minor key with a mix of i-IV-V and ii-V progressions**: Given the guitar sample's potential key signature, consider using a mix of F minor's diatonic chords (i: F minor, IV: Bb major, V: C major) and ii-V progressions (ii: G minor, V: C major). This will create a sense of tension and release, while maintaining the song's energetic feel.
* **Employ the Dorian mode to add a touch of funk and disco**: As mentioned in the knowledge chunk, the Dorian mode is reminiscent of funk and disco music. Consider using the F Dorian mode (F, G, A, Bb, C, D, Eb) in your melody and bassline to create a sense of forward motion and groove.
* **Incorporate a "shuttle" feel with a repetitive IV-i motion**: Building on the idea of the Dorian shuttle, consider using a repetitive IV-i motion (Bb major - F minor) every 4 bars to create a sense of forward motion and build energy. This will also help to create a sense of anticipation and release.
* **Experiment with syncopated rhythms and accenting off-beat notes**: To create a more modern and edgy sound, consider experimenting with syncopated rhythms and accenting off-beat notes. For example, you could emphasize the "and" of beat 2 in a 4/4 time signature, or add in extra rhythmic interest by accenting off-beat notes in the melody or bassline. This will help to create a more dynamic and engaging listening experience.

## Timbre & Instrumentation
* **Guitar Sample with a Twist**: Use a distorted, effects-heavy guitar sample reminiscent of Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit" or Daft Punk's "Get Lucky". To add interest, layer a soft, ambient synth (e.g., a detuned Moog or a soft synth like a Waldorf Wave) to complement the guitar's mid-range frequencies. This will create a sense of space and depth without overpowering the guitar.

* **Synth-Drum-Funk Hybrid**: Combine a driving, filtered synth drum sound (e.g., a Roland TR-808 or TR-909) with a bass synth that incorporates funk and disco elements (e.g., a Moog or a Waldorf Wave with a funk-inspired filter). Add some vinyl crackle or tape hiss to the synth drums to give them a warm, analog feel.

* **Funky, Fretless Bass**: Use a fretless bass synth (e.g., a Waldorf Wave or a software emulation of a bass synth like the Moog Sub 37) to create a smooth, funky bassline. Add some subtle, ambient pads (e.g., a soft synth or a granular synth) to enhance the bass's lower end and create a sense of depth.

* **Disco-Disco-Disco**: Create a bright, disco-inspired sound by layering a bright, piercing synth (e.g., a Roland Jupiter-8 or a Yamaha CS-80) with a disco-era-style drum sound (e.g., a sampled drum machine or a vintage drum synth). Add some disco-era-style percussion elements (e.g., shaker, tambourine, or congas) to create a sense of movement and energy.

## Production & Mix
* **Guitar Sample Panning and Depth**: Pan the guitar sample across the stereo field, creating a sense of width and depth. This will help create a more immersive experience and draw the listener's attention to the guitar. Additionally, experiment with depth effects such as reverb or delay to create a sense of distance and space. This will help the guitar sound more like it's coming from a distance, rather than being right in front of the listener.

* **Stereo Imaging and Mid-Side Processing**: Apply mid-side processing to create a wider stereo image for the drums and percussion. This will help create a more immersive and engaging soundstage. Experiment with different mid-side ratios and processing techniques to find the right balance for your track.

* **Disco-Inspired FX Chain**: Create a disco-inspired effects chain for the guitar sample by adding a subtle delay, followed by a gentle reverb and modulation. This will help create a sense of movement and energy, reminiscent of classic disco tracks. Experiment with different delay times, reverb settings, and modulation techniques to find the right combination for your track.

* **Vocal-Centric Mixing**: Focus on making the vocals the centerpiece of the mix by applying a gentle EQ boost between 100 Hz and 250 Hz. This will help bring the vocals to the front of the mix and create a more balanced sound. Experiment with different EQ settings and compression techniques to find the right balance for your track.

* **Percussion and FX Processing**: Experiment with different processing techniques on the percussion elements (e.g. snare, hi-hats, etc.) to create a more dynamic and engaging sound. This could include using compression, EQ, and stereo imaging techniques to create a more driving and energetic feel.

* **Guitar Sample Filtering**: Apply a gentle low-pass filter (LPF) to the guitar sample to create a more focused and punchy sound. This will help remove unwanted high-end frequencies and create a more defined sound. Experiment with different LPF cutoff frequencies and resonance settings to find the right balance for your track.
