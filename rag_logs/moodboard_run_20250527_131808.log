---
Based on the user's request for modern pop with jazz vibes, and analyzing the provided similarity analysis tracks, the project goal summary can be distilled into:

The goal is to create a modern pop song that seamlessly blends jazz elements, characteristic of iconic jazz-influenced tracks like "Take Five" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet, with contemporary pop sensibilities, similar to artists like Billie Eilish or Daft Punk. The song should feature a tempo range of 100-130 BPM, with a mix of jazz-inspired instrumentation, such as saxophone or piano, alongside modern pop elements like electronic beats and atmospheric synths. A key signature of C minor or F minor is implied, with a mood that balances the sophistication of jazz with the energy of modern pop.

The project aims to capture the essence of a jazz-infused pop sound, with a focus on creating a cohesive and engaging musical experience that appeals to a wide audience.

“Pop” music is rarely recorded live, except at live events such as concerts, but is created in the recording studio. Acoustic and electrical sources are fed into a mixer and recorded on to a multitrack medium, often a few tracks at a time, gradually building up a montage of sounds. The resulting recording then contains a collection of individual sources on multiple tracks which must subsequently be mixed into the final release format. Individual songs or titles are recorded in separate places on the tape, to be compiled later. It is not so common these days to record multitrack pop titles in “takes” for later edit- ing, as with classical music, since mixer automation allows the engineer to work on a song in sections for automatic execution in sequence by a computer

As a performance-based control language, MIDI complements modern music production, by allow- ing a performance track to be edited, layered, altered, spindled, mutilated, and improved with relative ease under completely automated computer control and after the fact, during post-production. If you played a bad note, fix it. If you want to change the key or tempo of a piece, change it. If you want to change the expressive volume of a phrase in a song, just do it! Even its sonic character (timbre) can be changed! These capabilities merely hint at the power of this medium that widely affects the project studio, professional studio, audio or visual and film, live performance, multimedia, and even your cell phone!

Playback. Once a composition is complete, all of the MIDI tracks in a project can be transmitted through the various MIDI ports and channels to plug-ins, instruments, or devices for playback. Since the data exists as encoded real-time control commands, you can listen to the sequence and make changes at any time. For example, you could change instrument settings (by changing or editing patch voices), alter volume and other mix changes, or experiment with such controllers as pitch bend, modu- lation or aftertouch, and even change the tempo and key signature. In short, this medium is infinitely flexible how a performance and/or set of parameters can be created, saved, folded, spindled, and muti- lated until you’ve arrived at the sound and feel that you want.

You are a helpful music production and mixing assistant.
Your goal is to provide actionable and creative suggestions related to overall production, mixing, and effects.

Based on the following overall project goal:
---
Based on the user's request for modern pop with jazz vibes, and analyzing the provided similarity analysis tracks, the project goal summary can be distilled into:

The goal is to create a modern pop song that seamlessly blends jazz elements, characteristic of iconic jazz-influenced tracks like "Take Five" by The Dave Brubeck Quartet, with contemporary pop sensibilities, similar to artists like Billie Eilish or Daft Punk. The song should feature a tempo range of 100-130 BPM, with a mix of jazz-inspired instrumentation, such as saxophone or piano, alongside modern pop elements like electronic beats and atmospheric synths. A key signature of C minor or F minor is implied, with a mood that balances the sophistication of jazz with the energy of modern pop.

The project aims to capture the essence of a jazz-infused pop sound, with a focus on creating a cohesive and engaging musical experience that appeals to a wide audience.

Playback. Once a composition is complete, all of the MIDI tracks in a project can be transmitted through the various MIDI ports and channels to plug-ins, instruments, or devices for playback. Since the data exists as encoded real-time control commands, you can listen to the sequence and make changes at any time. For example, you could change instrument settings (by changing or editing patch voices), alter volume and other mix changes, or experiment with such controllers as pitch bend, modu- lation or aftertouch, and even change the tempo and key signature. In short, this medium is infinitely flexible how a performance and/or set of parameters can be created, saved, folded, spindled, and muti- lated until you’ve arrived at the sound and feel that you want.

Acoustic and electrical sources are fed into a mixer and recorded on to a multitrack medium, often a few tracks at a time, gradually building up a montage of sounds. The resulting recording then contains a collection of individual sources on multiple tracks which must subsequently be mixed into the final release format. Individual songs or titles are recorded in separate places on the tape, to be compiled later. It is not so common these days to record multitrack pop titles in “takes” for later edit- ing, as with classical music, since mixer automation allows the engineer to work on a song in sections for automatic execution in sequence by a computer\n\n---\n\nContent from KB: production/Douglas_Self_Audio_Engineering_Explained.pdf (Pg: 428):\nAs a performance-based control language, MIDI complements modern music production, by allow- ing a performance track to be edited, layered, altered, spindled, mutilated, and improved with relative ease under completely automated computer control and after the fact, during post-production. If you played a bad note, fix it. If you want to change the key or tempo of a piece, change it. If you want to change the expressive volume of a phrase in a song, just do it! Even its sonic character (timbre) can be changed!

CHAPTER 3. COMBINING TIME AND PITCH

rhythm (Section 1.1), tempo (Section 1.5), texture (Section 3.1), or timbre (Section 2.1.1) keep each section sounding fresh and interesting. Writing a set of variations is considered an excellent exercise for students interested in composing, arranging, and orchestration.

Jazz standard song form - Jazz utilizes many di(cid:27)erent forms, but one very common form is closely related to the strophic and variation forms. A chord progression (Chords, p. 53) in A A B A form (with the B section called the bridge (p. 94)) is repeated many times. On the (cid:28)rst and last repetition, the melody is played or sung, and soloists improvise during the other repetitions. The overall form of verse-like repetition, with the melody played only the (cid:28)rst and (cid:28)nal times, and improvisations on the other repetitions, is very common in jazz even when the A A B A song form is not being used.

Materials and Preparation

If your students have a strong sense of rhythm, they can do this no-background-music version of the activity.

Provide each student with a percussion instrument, or let them decide on their own "found" or "body" percussion.

Decide whether you will provide and teach the rhythms, or let the students come up with their own, or use the same rhythms they have been playing in the previous activity.

Designate one student with a fairly loud instrument as the beat keeper. This student establishes the beat and plays steadily on the beat during the entire session.

Other students enter one at a time, steadily playing their rhythms, to produce a complex rhythmic ostinato. If they do this well, the result should sound like the background rhythm track to a pop, rock, or Latin tune.

CHAPTER 1. TIME ELEMENTS

Again, choose songs with a variety of meters. Some students will (cid:28)nd singing and clapping at the same time to be more of a challenge; choose simple songs that the children already know how to sing con(cid:28)dently, with a steady, consistent beat and strong rhythm. Songs that they are already learning in music class are an excellent choice.

1. The procedure is similar to the "Listen for Meter" procedure. This time, the children will tap their toes and clap while they are singing.

2. When listening for simple or compound meter, let the students take turns; some will sing while others are counting the beats and divisions of beats. If the melody is very simple, older students with more musical experience may be able to sing "one-and-two-and-etc.", to the tune, but remember that the rhythm of the song is not the same as the meter, and the two will not always match up, even in a simple song.

Al- though the tone is generally aimed at musicians and people with little prior knowledge of music systems, there may be some mathematical concepts and pro- gramming techniques that are not familiar. The book focuses on synthesis from a digital perspective rather than an analogue one, since it aims to demonstrate the theory of digital synthesis rather than applications to a specific medium or piece of software.

The triplet rhythm notated in Example 1 is a common way to explain

swing, but in reality, the exact ratio of swing eighths varies from piece

to piece and from performer to performer. Generally speaking, faster

Note: Some jazz musicians prefer to think of a swing rhythm as more of a heavy accent on the second eighth, rather than as a triplet rhythm, particularly

when the tempo is fast. This distinction is not important for students of music theory, but jazz students will want to work hard on using both rhythm and

articulation to produce a convincing "swing".

Figure 1.64 Swing Rhythms Jazz or blues with a "swing" rhythm often assumes that all divisions are

triplets. The swung triplets may be written as triplets, or they may simply be written as "straight" eighth

notes or dotted eighth-sixteenths. If rhythms are not written as triplets, the tempo marking usually includes

an indication to "swing", or it may simply be implied by the style and genre of the music.

This will give your track a classic jazz-influenced feel. For example, use a snappy snare on beats 2 and 4, with a soft ride cymbal on the "1" and "3" counts. This will create a sense of tension and release, perfect for a breakdown section.\n* **Jazz-Funk Stomp**: Design a drum pattern that combines the best of jazz and funk. Use a driving kick drum on beats 1 and 3, with a snappy snare on beats 2 and 4. Add some flavor with a hi-hat pattern that emphasizes the "2" and "4" counts, with a subtle "crash" on the "1" count. This will give your track a fun, energetic feel that\'s perfect for a pop song.\n* **C minor Groove**: Create a drum pattern that takes advantage of the C minor key signature.

To create a jazz-inspired chord progression, try a variation of the ii-V-I progression, but with a twist. For example, use a C minor dominant 7th chord (Cm7) as the ii chord, a F minor 7th chord (Fm7) as the V chord, and a G minor 7th chord (Gm7) as the I chord. This progression is a common one in jazz, but with a modern pop twist.\n* **Modal Interchange with the F Major Scale**: To add some jazz flavor to your song, try incorporating the F major scale (F, G, A, Bb, C, D, E, F) into your harmony. You can do this by using the F major scale as a harmonic minor scale (F, G, Ab, Bb, C, Db, E, F) and incorporating it into your chord progression. For example, you could use an F major 7th chord (Fmaj7) as a harmonic minor chord, or use the F major scale as a melodic motif. This will give your song a more sophisticated feel.\n* **Syncopated Rhythms with a 3-4 Time Signature**: To create a more dynamic and interesting rhythmic feel, try using a 3-4 time signature (common time with a strong emphasis on beat 3). You can do this by using syncopated rhythms, where you emphasize off-beat notes (e.g. the "and" of beat 2 in a 3-4 time signature). For example, you could use a hi-hat pattern that emphasizes the "and" of beat 2, and then plays the quarter notes on beat 3. This will give your song a more driving and energetic feel.\n* **Altered Dominants with a C Major Scale**: To add some tension and release to your song, try using altered dominants. For example, you could use a C major 7th chord (Cmaj7) as the V chord, but with an added flatted 5th (Cm5) to create a sense of tension. This will give your song a more dramatic feel. You can use the C major scale as a basis for your melody, and then incorporate altered dominants into your harmony. This will give your song a more sophisticated and jazz-inspired feel.', 'music_theory_kb_sources': ['KB: theory_general/Understanding_Basic_Music_Theory_hk_r.pdf (Pg: 206)', 'KB: theory_general/OPEN_MUSIC_THEORY_V2.pdf (Pg: 552)', 'KB: theory_general/Understanding_Basic_Music_Theory_hk_r.pdf (Pg: 46)'], 'music_theory_stack_sources': [], 'instruments_advice': '### Jazz-Influenced Instrumentation Suggestions\n\n* **Saxophone & Electronics**: Use a vintage-inspired saxophone sound (e.g., a custom-made or sampled sound) and layer it with electronic elements like ambient pads, filtered synth leads, or a subtle vocoder effect. This will create a rich, jazzy sound with a modern twist.\n* **Piano & Harmonium**: Combine a grand piano with a harmonium or a vintage-inspired electric piano sound. Use the harmonium to add a subtle, wavering texture to the piano parts, creating a sense of tension and release.\n* **Acoustic & Electric Drums**: Use a combination of acoustic and electronic drums to create a dynamic, layered sound. For example, use an acoustic drum kit for the foundation and add electronic elements like tambourines, shakers, or a subtle kick drum effect.\n\n### Sound Design Suggestions\n\n* **Reverb & Spatial Effects**: Use liberal amounts of reverb and spatial effects to create a sense of depth and space. For example, use a plate reverb on the saxophone or a large room reverb on the piano.\n* **Filtering & Processing**: Use filtering and processing techniques to create interesting textures and timbres. For example, use a low-pass filter on the electric piano or a high-pass filter on the acoustic drums.\n* **Vocal Processing**: Use creative vocal processing techniques to add a touch of jazz and modernity to the vocals. For example, use a vocoder effect on the lead vocals or a subtle phaser effect on the harmonies.\n\n### Timbre & Texture Suggestions\n\n* **Layered Woodwind**: Use a combination of woodwind instruments like clarinet, flute, and saxophone to create a layered, jazz-inspired sound. For example, use a clarinet to play a melody and add a flute to play a harmony.\n* **Acoustic & Electronic Percussion**: Combine acoustic and electronic percussion elements to create a dynamic, layered sound. For example, use an acoustic drum kit for the foundation and add electronic elements like tambourines, shakers, or a subtle kick drum effect.\n* **String Section**: Use a string section to add a touch of elegance and sophistication to the track.

This will create a sense of tension and release, setting the tone for the rest of the track.\n* **Use stereo widening and depth**: To create a sense of space and width, use stereo widening techniques to separate the instruments and sounds. This can be achieved using plugins like the "Stereo Widener" or "Imager". Additionally, experiment with depth by adding subtle amounts of reverb and delay to create a sense of distance and layering.\n* **Apply "Jazz-Inspired" EQ curves**: Use EQ curves to enhance the jazz-inspired sounds in the track. For example, boost the low-mids (200-300 Hz) to give the saxophone or piano a warm, rich sound. Use a "Jazz-Inspired" EQ curve template (or create your own) to enhance the overall sound and create a sense of clarity.\n* **Incorporate "Swing" and "Stutter" effects**: To create a sense of movement and energy, incorporate "Swing" and "Stutter" effects into the track. Use a plugin like the "Groove" or "Stutter Editor" to create a sense of rhythmic movement and tension. This can be particularly effective on electronic drum sounds and percussion.\n* **Use "Modulation" to create a sense of movement**: Use modulation effects (e.g., LFO, Envelope Generator) to create a sense of movement and tension in the track. This can be particularly effective on synthesizers, keyboards, and other electronic instruments.

This can be achieved using plugins like the "Stereo Widener" or "Imager". Additionally, experiment with depth by adding subtle amounts of reverb and delay to create a sense of distance and layering.\n* **Apply "Jazz-Inspired" EQ curves**: Use EQ curves to enhance the jazz-inspired sounds in the track. For example, boost the low-mids (200-300 Hz) to give the saxophone or piano a warm, rich sound. Use a "Jazz-Inspired" EQ curve template (or create your own) to enhance the overall sound and create a sense of clarity.\n* **Incorporate "Swing" and "Stutter" effects**: To create a sense of movement and energy, incorporate "Swing" and "Stutter" effects into the track. Use a plugin like the "Groove" or "Stutter Editor" to create a sense of rhythmic movement and tension. This can be particularly effective on electronic drum sounds and percussion.\n* **Use "Modulation" to create a sense of movement**: Use modulation effects (e.g., LFO, Envelope Generator) to create a sense of movement and tension in the track. This can be particularly effective on synthesizers, keyboards, and other electronic instruments. Experiment with different modulation techniques to create a sense of dynamic energy and interest.\n\n\n## Potential Sources Referenced:\n\n1.
