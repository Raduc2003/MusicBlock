# 🎛️ MusicBlock: The Blueprint

**MusicBlock** is a creative assistant for music makers that turns short musical ideas—like a melody or vibe description—into a moodboard of inspiration. It analyzes both **audio** and **text** inputs to recommend related genres, instruments, styles, and reference tracks using a modular recommendation engine.

The system uses feature extraction + vector similarity to guide users toward musical directions that match or evolve their intent.
